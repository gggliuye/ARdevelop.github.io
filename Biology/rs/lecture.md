One of my favorite sentences :

"The same exact bioloy may make somebody a schizophrenia in a milder form,
will have them being very interested in meta-magical issues, and in the mildest
form allows you to have a fantasy while standing on line in the supermarket.
It's the same biology on the same continuum, and somewhere in there, it stops
being *them and their diseases* and becomes *us and who we are*."


## Biological Underpinnings of Religiosity

This is the 'final lecture' that he mentioned he decided
not to record/post on the official Stanford version of this course.
You can see an old version in [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WwAQqWUkpI&list=PLD7E21BF91F3F9683&index=33&ab_channel=RaulSoto) .

### Schizotypal personality

From the gene lectures we learned that : **there is no bad gene, but only gene in a bad gene-environment interaction.**

Recall the depression class and the schizophrenia lectures.
Schizophrenia has strong genetic factor, while at the end of last lecture,
Prof said we didn't come up with a good trait of it. While a milder version of
schizophrenia may help.

There is an experiment that interview thousands of families of schizophrenia in Danmark.
The biological family members have a milder genetic version, now called **schizotypal personality**.

**Expressions** :

* Loose associations, Social withdraw, in some degree (not to schizophrenia level).
* Meta-magical thinking, kind of believe in strange things, science fiction, UFOs, etc. And this is someone who if they have a religious structure of belief, has an extermely **concrete** level of interpretation.

We could relate these concrete image to "the seven days" that god creates the world, snacks with apples, people alive that are once dead, etc.

### Religion

**Shamansim**. There are lectures in 1930s, 40s (anthorpologist, Paul Raiden) "half crazy", Shamans, witch doctors, etc. This was recongized
as a very controlled very socially contextual version of meta-magical schizotypalism. These are the people who
do things *at the right time*. And studies show in most cultures, we always need some meta-magical people around, and they have high social status.
Devereaux referred to primitive religion as being organized schizophrenia, 1940s.
But we are all equally irrational. It leads to **ritualism**.

And we all fall into obsessive little rituals during times of anxiety. We also have rituals intrusive
thoughts that just invade our heads at times where with on obvious purpose.

**OCD**, an anxiety disorder. While there are tremendous advantages of a milder version of OCD.

The leaders of religion, have the best vivid images, and are best at doing the rituals. e.g. Brahmin, in Hinduism.
**numerology**.

They are not to make the anxiety goes away, it's to share it in communities.
But why we need these rituals, why we need a community to share.

People can make a living by doing rituals. (Science fiction : "Xenocide" by Orson Scott Card, a group of people doing nothing other than carrying
out rituals, and other people work hard to feed them) Historical example: 16th century Augustinian monk in Germany named Ludar, Martin Luther.

Experiment with pigeons, with random reward, generate a "superstitious belief".
Allow you to see casual link, that doesn't exist.
