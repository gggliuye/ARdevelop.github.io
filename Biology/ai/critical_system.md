title: Critical Systems
---


Critical systems exhibit optimal computational properties, suggesting that the possibility that criticality has been evolutionarily selected as a useful trait for our nervous system.

* Self-organized criticality:
  * For large finite system, there will be **a small region** (not a single isolated point) that shows properties of critical systems in an approximate sense.
  * **Quasi**-criticality : our brain, subject to external inputs, cannot reach critical point, can only be close to it.
  * **Manifold** : the critical point is actually a Manifold which has one dimension less than the embedding parameter.
  * **Self-organized** : the control parameter is set by the system itself.
* **Critical slowing down** : near critical point the recovery from perturbation is slow - the memory of the perturbation is retained for a long time. (analysis by linearization near critical point)
* **Power-laws** is a typical property of critical system, as seen everywhere in nature.
  * Problem : Power-laws in nature can be explained by other mechanisms.
* **Scale independence** (show similar pattern at all scales), as shown in avalanches. Though, inputs can be processed in parallel, and integrated over the whole system.
  * Problem : Avalanches distribution identification is hard.
* **Models** demonstrate that the self-organization to critical states in the brain is feasible and plausible.

Friendly explain the problem **for beginners**, using [Ising model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ising_model).
* **communication is optimal at critical point** : high dynamic correlation, and high correlation over large distance (large correlation length).
  * coupling and variability are balanced to produce long distance communication.
  * storage and power are optimized as well.
* **power law** -> scale free (-> fractal structure, self-similarity).
  * power law & artifacts. power law & exponentials.
  * power law can be generated by other mechanisms.
* Ising model is equilibrium model, while neural networks are dynamic.
  * applying perturbation to Ising model - Barkhausen effect.
* More evidences (<n>but not strong enough yet</n>).
  1. The ability to tune the network from a subcritical regime through criticality to supercritical regime (**phase transitions**).
    * The balance between excitation and inhibition can serve as a control parameter.
  2. The existence of mathematical relationships between **the exponents of the power** for a system.
    * Multiple power laws exist.
  3. The existence of **data collapse** within neural data.
    * Avalanche shapes (time-size plot) are similar for difference scales.

(1) shows the edge of chaos predicts quite well those values of circuit parameters that yield maximal computational performance. (2) propose a new method for predicting the computational performance of neural microcircuit models.
