[Modern Art & Ideas](https://www.coursera.org/learn/modern-art-ideas/home/module/1)

[Modern art - MoMA](https://www.moma.org/collection/terms/modern-art) : many artists began exploring dreams, symbolism, and personal iconography as avenues for the depiction of their subjective experiences. Challenging the notion that art must realistically depict the world, some artists experimented with the expressive use of color, non-traditional materials, and new techniques and mediums.

<summary style="width: 100%;">The Starry Night by Vincent van Gogh.</summary>
Vincent van Gogh produced emotional, visually arresting paintings over the course of a career that lasted only a decade. Nature, and the people living closely to it, first stirred his artistic inclinations and continued to inspire him throughout his short life. But rather than faithfully depicting his surroundings, he painted landscapes altered by his imagination, including The Starry Night. Van Gogh was seeking respite from plaguing depression at the Saint-Paul asylum in Saint-Rémy in southern France when he painted The Starry Night. It reflects his direct observations of his view of the countryside from his window as well as the memories and emotions this view evoked in him. The steeple of the church, for example, resembles those common in his native Netherlands, while the mountains in the background describe those in his surrounding landscape.

<summary  style="width: 100%;">A vision of New York City filtered through the abstraction of Piet Mondrian.</summary>
In the fall of 1940, Dutch-born artist Piet Mondrian left his adopted city of Paris for New York to escape the Nazi takeover of France. In Europe, he had established himself as one of the pioneers of De Stijl, a form of abstraction that renounced naturalistic representation in favor of a stripped-down formal vocabulary consisting of straight lines, rectangular planes, and primary colors (red, blue, and yellow) meant to create visual harmony and restore order and balance to everyday life. Painted decades later, Broadway Boogie Woogie still reflects the De Stijl aesthetic—but jolted by Mondrian’s enamored response to New York City and his love of the boogie-woogie jazz music that flourished there. Claiming, “The emotion of beauty is always obscured by the appearance of the object. Therefore, the object must be eliminated from the picture,” he captured the city’s buildings, lights, crowds, traffic, and the rhythms of its jazz music in an abstract language of colored squares.

<summary style="width: 100%;">Bingo: Gordon Matta-Clark’s sculpture made from pieces of a demolished home</summary>
Unlike most architects, who would be inclined to renovate old buildings or replace them with new ones, Gordon Matta-Clark used his training in architecture to dismantle buildings—including a derelict house in Niagara Falls, New York—and transform them into works of art. Once thriving, this town had lost its luster by the 1970s. Matta-Clark saw in its abandoned homes an opportunity to practice what he called “anarchitecture”—a combination of anarchy and architecture—through which he drew attention to non-functional or overlooked buildings, architectural sites, and spaces. With a small team of workers, he cut the house’s northern façade into nine equally sized rectangles so that it resembled a bingo game card, after which this work is titled. He left the central rectangle on the house, deposited five in a nearby sculpture park where he hoped they would be reabsorbed into the earth, and kept three, which are now in <a href="https://www.moma.org/collection/works/91762">MoMA’s collection</a>. These are displayed aligned on the gallery floor so that viewers can walk around them and see segments of both the interior and exterior of the house. By inserting pieces of the outside world into an art museum, Matta-Clark hoped to draw attention to the troubled state of a real world place and its affected residents.

<summary style="width: 100%;">Norman Lewis. City Night</summary>
Lewis’s paintings, like those of many Abstract Expressionists, straddle the boundary between abstraction and figuration. The predominantly dark palette of this work evokes the nocturnal cityscape of the title; the delicate lines that crisscross the surface have been interpreted as laundry lines or power lines. In City Night Lewis has transformed this quotidian subject matter into an atmospheric and luminous abstraction. “The elements of painting constitute a language in themselves,” the artist wrote in 1949; the dynamic interplay of light and dark in City Night demonstrates his deft control over the medium.

<summary style="width: 100%;">Andrew Wyeth. Christina’s World</summary>
Andrew Wyeth painted the landscape, objects, and residents of only two places: his lifelong home village of Chadds Ford, Pennsylvania and the area around the neighboring coastal villages of Port Clyde and South Cushing, Maine, where he spent summers. Anna Christina Olson, who appears in this and many of his other paintings, was Wyeth’s neighbor in Maine. A neuromuscular disease had left her unable to walk. When he saw her dragging herself home one day across her family’s yard, he was inspired to make a painting conveying her indomitableness. He did this by combining direct observation with imagination. While he faithfully depicted her fragile arms and hands, for example, he replaced her family’s small yard with a vast field. “Christina’s world is, because of her physical handicap, outwardly limited—but in this painting I tried to convey how unlimited it really is,” he once wrote.

<summary style="width: 100%;">Salvador Dalí. The Persistence of Memory</summary>
With its uncanny, otherworldly feel, and its melting pocket watches and mollusk-like central figure strewn about a barren landscape, Salvador Dalí’s The Persistence of Memory seems wholly imaginary. In fact, it sprang not only from the artist’s imagination, but also from his memories of the coastline of his native Catalonia, Spain. As he once explained: “This picture represented a landscape near Port Lligat, whose rocks were lighted by a transparent and melancholy twilight; in the foreground an olive tree with its branches cut, and without leaves.” Dalí applied the methods of <u>Surrealism, tapping deep into the non-rational mechanisms of his mind—dreams, wild imaginings</u>, and his subconscious—to generate the unreal forms that populate this painting. These blend seamlessly with features based on the real world, including the rocky ridge in the painting’s upper-right-hand corner, which describes the cliffs of the Cap de Creus peninsula.

<summary style="width: 100%;">Rachel Whiteread. Water Tower</summary>
“Something that I often do is try and give those places and spaces that have never really had a place in the world some sort of authority, and some sort of voice,” sculptor Rachel Whiteread once explained. Among the objects that have captured her attention are the ubiquitous yet easy-to-overlook water towers dotting New York’s skyline. Though these rooftop structures once held water for the city’s buildings, they are now falling out of use. On commission for the Public Art Fund, Whiteread decided to highlight the presence of these towers. Using translucent resin—which she chose for <u>its evocation of water and ability to capture and take on the changing light of the sky—she made a cast of the interior of a cedar water tower</u> (a space we would otherwise never see) and then installed it on a rooftop in Soho, a neighborhood characterized by low-rise buildings.

<summary style="width: 100%;">Edward Hopper. House by the Railroad.</summary>
Painter and printmaker Edward Hopper produced closely observed urban views, landscapes (largely of New England), and interior scenes—all either devoid of or sparsely populated by people. Though he insisted that his paintings were straightforward representations of the real world, their overall sparseness imbues them with <u>a sense of loneliness</u>, estrangement, and stillness. Light, whether from electric bulbs or the sun, defines the places he depicts and shapes the mood of his works. A late afternoon glow pervades House by the Railroad, which features a grand Victorian home fronted by the tracks of a railroad. The tracks create a visual barrier that seems to block access to house, which appears moored and isolated in the surrounding empty landscape. Its old-fashioned architecture and lack of any sense of occupancy imply that the house may be a relic of tradition, lonely and forgotten in the push towards urbanization and progress, as suggested by the railroad tracks.

<summary style="width: 100%;">Louis I. Kahn. Sher-e-Bangla Nagar, Capital of Bangladesh, Dhaka, Bangladesh.</summary>
The construction of Louis I. Kahn’s Sher-e-Bangla Nagar (the city of the Bengal Tiger) unfolded over the course of 20 years in a radically shifting political context. Kahn was a lauded architect known for his monumental buildings when the Pakistani government commissioned him in 1963 to design a governmental and civic complex incorporating a national assembly building, a mosque, residences, offices, a dining hall, courtrooms, a hospital, a museum, and schools. It was to be situated in Dhaka, Bangladesh, and was begun when that country was still a part of Pakistan. In addition to functioning as the political center of Pakistan’s second capital city, it was meant to stand as <u>a symbol of national unity</u>. Kahn addressed these goals by designing a monumental structure based on square, circular, and triangular shapes and permeated with apertures that allow light to flood its grand interior spaces. In 1971, Bangladesh won independence from Pakistan. This inevitably changed the purpose of Sher-e-Bangla Nagar, which would not be completed for another 12 years, and it became instead an emblem of a newly independent nation.

<summary style="width: 100%;">Zarina. Home is a foreign Place</summary>
Born in Aligarh, India, to a Muslim family, Zarina grew up aware of the political and religious struggles between her native country and neighboring Pakistan, a majority-Muslim state, which was partitioned from the majority-Hindu India in 1947 by the British. Zarina, once explained: “This piece is my narrative of the house I was born in and left in my early twenties never to return.”<br>
Home Is a Foreign Place consists of 36 woodblock prints, each of which presents a geometric, monochromatic design. To make these images, Zarina jotted down a list of Urdu words that she considered meaningful, such as “axis,” “distance,” “road,” and “wall.” She sent the list to a calligrapher in Pakistan, who wrote them in the traditional nastaliq script. Back in her New York studio, Zarina developed what she has described as “idea-images, which flowed from these words.” The resultant images serve as a visual vocabulary to express <u>feelings of home, memory, and loss</u>. “I understood from a very early age that home is not necessarily a permanent place,” Zarina said. “It is an idea we carry with us wherever we go. We are our homes.”
