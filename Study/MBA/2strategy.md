# 1. Strategic Analysis


Business strategy produces the major policies and plans for achieving a company's goals.

**Strategic Analysis**: the assessment of an organization's current competitive position and the identification of valuable competitive positions in the future and how to achieve them.
* From a generalist perspective (integrative, foundational).
* Using strategic reasoning (rivalry, dynamics, complexity).
* Grounded in analytics and data.
* Applying appropriate tools and frameworks.

## 1.2 Strategist's Challenge

<u>The Strategist's Challenge:</u> balancing values, opportunities, and capabilities to identify the desirable competitive positions that create and sustain value.
1. **Values** - What are the values of the organization, i.e. the values, the mission, the scope of the organization.
  * **Mission Statements** defines who a company is and what it's trying to achieve, which is the foundation of its strategy.
  * Goolge, Dell, Citigroup, etc
2. **Opportunities** - market value, market demand, space.
3. **Capabilities** - competitive advantage.

## 1.3 Market Inefficiency & Opportunities

Fundamental Principle of Business Strategy : <u>"if everyone can do it, it's difficult to create and capture value from it." or "In a perfectly competitive market, no firm realizes economic profits (rents)"</u>。
* Rents : Accounting Profit & Economic Profit
  * Accounting Profit (subtracting only operating costs).
  * Economic Profit (subtracting both operating and opportunity costs) (replacement value).
* Measure Economic Profit:
  * Tobin's Q: ration of a firm's market value to its asset replacement value (hard to require knowledge).
  * Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) : measure value of firm going forward. Discount rate relects return to equity. Net present value.
* Firms in a competitive market are price takers, meaning they <u>charge the prevailing market price.</u>
  * Price should equal marginal cost (the cost of one additional unit).
  * Profits = Revenues - Variable Costs - Fixed Costs. $\pi=  P_{1}q_{1} - c(q_{1}) - c_{f}$
  * $\partial\pi / \partial q_{1} = 0$ leads to $P_{1} - c'(q_{1}) = 0$, $P_{1} = c'(q_{1}) \triangleq MC$ : Marginal cost.
* The existence of economic profits suggests some type of market inefficiency and our task as strategists is to identify ways in which firms may capitalize on these market imperfections.
  * Perfectly competitive markets are exceedingly rare.
* Two perspectives on Rents: (how firms achieve superior performance)
  * Monopoly Rents (Industrial Organization View) : Barriers to entry; Industry structure matters.
  * Ricardian Rents (Resource Based View) : Barriers to imitation; Firm structure matters.
* **The role of the strategist is then to identify these potential sources of competitive advantage.**

## 1.4 Tools
<p></p>

* [SWOT Analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SWOT_analysis) : Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, Threats.
* <u>Competitor Analysis</u>. performance metrics, capabilities, objectives/value, strategy.
* <u>Environmental Analysis</u>. Demographic Trends, Socio-Cultural Influences, Technological Developments, Macroeconomic Impacts, Political-Legal Pressures, Global Trade Issues.

# 2. Analyzing Industry Structure

**Five Forces Analysis** focuses on the structure of an industry and how the competitive dynamics of that industry affect the profitability potential for firms in that industry.

<u>(1) Threat of Entry.</u> Entry is less likely when :
* Entrant faces high sunk costs (沉沒成本 costs cannot be recovered).
* Incumbents (現任) have a competitive advantage. (patents & licenses, pioneering brands, pre-commitment contracts, large economics of scale, steep learning curves, etc)
* Entrant faces retaliation (by strategic behavior of incumbents).

<u>(2) Threat of Substitutes.</u> (similar product but not exactly the same - butter and margarine).
* **Cross-Price Elasticity** : perfectly elastic, moderately, perfectly inelastic.
* Switching costs: (apple ios <-> android)

<u>(3) Bargaining Power of Buyers.</u> buyers have less power when:
* Buyers are not concentrated (no monopsony).
* Buyers have few options:
  * Differentiated product
  * High switching costs (relationship-specific assets)
  * Buyer cannot [backward integrate](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/backwardintegration.asp) (向本業之上游(供應商)整合, e.g. Walmart & Coca-Cola).
* Buyers are segmented - *Price Discrimination*:
  * 1st degree : to maximize willingness to buy.
  * 2nd degree : self-sorting. Airlines will price their tickets to different types of consumers differently.
  * 3rd degree : sorting by groups. Bundling.

<u>(4) Bargaining Power of Suppliers.</u> Suppliers are less of threat when :
* Sellers are not concentrated (no monopoly).
* Firms have many alternatives.
* Sellers may not treat segments differently. (price information widely available)

<u>(5) Intensity of Rivalry.</u> less intense when :
* Small number of competitors ?
* Incentive to "fight" are low: Substantial market growth; Opportunities to Differentiate; Low exit costs; Little excess capacity.
* Coordination is feasible (tacit coordination).

Others : Role of Complemnets, Role of Institutions.

# 3. Analyzing Firm Capabilities

<u>Barriers to imitation - Cost Advantage. v.s. Demand Advantage.</u>

<div align="center">    
<img src="/assets/img/company/advantage.jpeg" width="55%"/>
</div>

**The Value Chain - Resources to Capabilities** (describes all the steps necessary to bring a product to market): (1) analyzing capabilities is use the value chain to articulate the capabilities of the firm; (2) unpack those capabilities by understanding the people, processes, and systems that under-ride the ability to deliver those capabilities.

|  | Tangible | Intangible|
|---|--------|---------|
|People Assets | Cash, Physical Plant, Patents, Talent | Brands, Reputation, Technical Expertise, Loyalty |
| Systems Processes | Contracts/Alliances, IT Systems | Positive Culture, Talent Acquisition |

**Alignment** of capabilities both internally and externally.

**Sustainability of Advantages** captured and sustained.
* **Imitability**. legal barriers present; control scarce (稀缺) supply; unique historical path; socially complex (Disney); tight combinations (Facebook); credibly commitment.
* **Durability**. assets degrade; rigidities; obsolete as time change, selling assets.

**Building Capabilities**: (1) Acquired from others (require imperfect market); (2) Develop internally (needs <u>know-why or know-how</u>).

# 4. Determining Competitive Position

Generic Competitive Positions:

|   | (Low) Cost Source | Uniqueness Source |
|---|-----|---------------|
| Broad Scope | Cost Leadership | Differentiation (Brand, Innovation, Human resources) |
| Narrow Scope | Focused Low-Cost (often used as entry strategy) | Niche (premium group) |

Integrated Strategies, offering differentiated products at low cost. Example : Toyota, Southwest Airlines.

Strategist's Toolkit: Strategy Maps

Question to ask:
* What favorable strategic opportunities exist?
* How contested is a position ?
  * New markets (Blue Ocean Strategy)
  * Existing markets (Red Ocean Strategy)
* Can we establish this competitive position ?
  * Do we have the capabilities to execute ?
  * Can we create value in unique ways versus established competitors?
* Can we defend this position once established ?
  * Sustainability, Evolution?
