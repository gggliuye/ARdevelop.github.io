# 2. Life cycle and Methodologies

**Life cycle:**
1. <u>Initiate the project.</u>
  * Define project goals.
  * Determine resources, people and other project details.
  * Get project approval.
2. <u>Make a plan.</u>
  * Create a budget.
  * Set the schedule.
  * Establish your team.
  * Plan for risk and change. (reduce risk)
  * Establish communications.
3. <u>Execute & complete tasks.</u>
  * Manage the progress.

  * Confirm acceptance of the project outcome.

  * Communicate results with stakeholders.
  * Celebrate completing the project.

A project management methodology is a set of guiding principles and processes for owning a project through its life cycle. The method can be **linear** (with one task completed before the next can begin) or **iterative** (with some tasks happening at the same time).

(1) **Waterfall**  traditional methodology in which tasks and phases are completed in a linear, sequential manner, and each stage of the project must be completed before the next begins. Project deliverables and plans are <u>well-established and documented</u> in the early stages of initiating and planning.

(2) **Agile** project phases overlap and tasks are <u>completed in iterations</u>. Planning happens in shorter iterations and focuses on delivering value quickly. Subsequent iterations are adjusted in response to feedback or unforeseen issues.

(3) **Lean and Six Sigma, DMAIC**. <u>Define, Measure (get data), Analyze (identify gaps and issues), Improve, Control.</u>
* Lean methodology : <u>the removal of waste</u> within an operation. By optimizing process steps and eliminating waste, only value is added at each phase of production.  
  * using 5S method : Sort, Set in order, Shine, Standarize, Sustain.
  * Kanban boards.
* Six Sigma standards : reduce variations by ensuring that <u>quality processes</u> are followed every time.
