[Project Execution: Running the Project](https://www.coursera.org/learn/project-execution-google/home/week/1).


# 1. Track the project

Benefits:
* Tracking make project transparent. **Transparency** is essential for accurate decision-making. And reduce risk of forgetting something.
* Tracking keeps all team members and stakeholders in touch with <u>deadlines and goals</u>.
* Tracking is crucial for <u>recognizing risks and issues</u> that can derail your progress.
* Tracking helps <u>build confidence</u> that the project is set to be delivered on time, in scope, and within budget.

Items to track : schedule, status of action items, milestones, costs, key decisions, changes, dependencies, risks.

Tracking methods : **GANTT chart** (waterfall methodology), **Roadmap** (for big milestones), **Burndown chart** (time/work, for tasks with details).

**Project status reports**

* [Template](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15AosSTQsnpOUf80p6n9ERgeIF_EFWqBU2TGvGb3xVf8/template/preview#gid=423863049)
* Components : Milestones and tasks, Summary, Issues, Status.
* ROAM analysis : resolved, owned, accepted, or mitigated.
* Overall Status (RAG),

# 2. Manage changes, risk and dependencies

(1) Change management. Types of changes (positive or negative):
* New or changing dependencies.
* Changing priorities.
* Capacity and people.
* Limitations on budget or resources.
* Scope creep.
* Force majeure.

(2) Dependency types, and Dependency management.

(3) Risk register. [Inherent risk matrix](https://www.auditboard.com/blog/what-is-a-risk-assessment-matrix/). Four categories: **ROAM** (resolved, owned, accepted, mitigated).

(4) Communicating changes to the team : small change - email, big change - team meeting & timeout.

# 3. Quality management
<p></p>

* [Quality standards](https://asq.org/quality-resources/learn-about-standards).
* [Quality planning](https://asq.org/quality-resources/quality-plans). (Identify relevant standards and how to satisfy them)
* **QA** Quality assurance. (Review process : Evaluate if the project is moving towards high-quality)
  * QA seeks to prevent defects before they occur.
* **QC** Quality control. (Monitor project results and delivery to determine if they are meeting desired results or not)
  * [QC is a subset of QA](https://asq.org/quality-resources/quality-assurance-vs-control).
  * QC aims to identify defects after they have happened and also entails taking corrective action to resolve these issues.

**Measuring customer satisfaction** : (1) Feedback surveys; (2) User acceptance test (UAT).

**Continuous improvement**, process improvement. based on outcomes.
* Data-driven improvement frameworks:
  1. **DMAIC** : Define, Measure, Analyze, Improve, Control.
  2. **PDCA** : Identify problem, fix the issue, assess whether success, Fine-tune the final fix - Plan, Do (fix), Check, Act (Fine-tune).
* Differentiating:
  * Projects.
  * Programs. collection of projects.
  * Portfolio. collection of projects and programs across the whole organization.

üëç **Retrospective** [Template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1G1uZpxgqQPYfqeS5Tb8SdJLoIghqNqU3MDwarE9NeIw/template/preview) : (1) Project summary (Goals and objectives, Duration, Team members, Methodology), (2) Key accomplishments, (3) Lessons learned, (4) Action items (turn their lessons into action items), (5) Future considerations, (6) Resources and notes.

# 4. Data-informed decision-making

[Project metrics](https://www.wrike.com/blog/what-are-project-management-performance-metrics/) **data types**: <u>(1) Productivity metrics : milestone, tasks, projections, duration, (2) Quality metrics : number of changes, issues, cost variance.</u>

Data (a collection of facts or information) analysis steps:
1. Ask. What is the problem? And, identifying your stakeholders and understanding their expectations.
2. Prepare. collect and store the data.
3. Process. ‚Äúclean‚Äù your data. (Discerning important data)
4. Analyze. draw conclusions, make predictions, and decide on next steps.
5. Share. (use data visualization)
6. Act.

**Presenting and visualizing data** : Show relationships (Scatter), Comparing values (Bar), Demonstrating composition (Pie Chart), Analyzing trends and behaviors (Line).

# 5. Leadership and influencing skills

**Effective Team Work**.

The factors that impact team effectiveness:
1. Psychological safety.
2. Dependability. (reliable and complete task on time)
3. Structure and clarity. (understanding of job expectations, knowledge of how to achieve, and consequence of performance)
