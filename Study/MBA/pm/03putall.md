[Project Planning: Putting It All Together](https://www.coursera.org/learn/project-planning-google/home/module/1) :
* **Schedule** : how to make accurate time estimates, and how to set milestones.
* **Budget** : how to build and manage a budget and how the procurement processes work.
* **Risk Management** : tools help to identify and manage different types of risk and how to use a risk management plan to communicate and resolve risks.
* **Communication Plan** : how to draft and manage a communication plan and how to organize project documentation.

Components of a project plan:
* <u>Project scope and goals, the Work Breakdown Structure (WBS), the budget, and management plans</u>.
* Tasks. Milestones. People. Documentation. Time.

# 1. Schedule

Project **kick-off meeting** agenda: Introduction, Background, Goals and scope, Roles, Collaboration, What comes next, Questions.

## 1.1 Milestones
Set up Milestones and Deadline.

**Work Breakdown Structure** (WBS) : sorts project milestones and tasks into the order they need to be completed. ([how and why](https://www.lucidchart.com/blog/how-to-create-a-work-breakdown-structure-and-why-you-should))
* Start with the high-level, overarching project picture. Brainstorm with your team to list the major deliverables and milestones.
* Identify the tasks that need to be performed in order to meet those milestones.
* Examine those tasks and break them down further into sub-tasks.

## 1.2 Time Estimation

The planning fallacy : our tendency to underestimate the amount of time used, due to optimism bias. -> **adding task buffers**.

**Capacity planning** (allocate enough people and resources to tasks) and the **Critical path** (tasks with top priority) ([reading 1](https://www.workamajig.com/blog/critical-path-method), [reading 2](https://www.wrike.com/blog/critical-path-is-easy-as-123/)):
1. Capture all tasks
2. Set dependencies
3. Create a network diagram
4. Make time estimates
5. Find the critical path

Getting accurate time estimates from your team (using *Soft Skills*) : Asking the right questions; Negotiating effectively; Practicing empathy.
