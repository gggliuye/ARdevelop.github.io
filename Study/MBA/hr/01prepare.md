|-------------|--------------|
| Minimize labor costs (low wages, few benefits, little training) | Engage employees (above-average pay, benefits, training) |

| Union suppression | Union substitution |
| "if you don't like it, quit" | "If you don't like it, let's talk " |

# 2. Monetary Aspects of Work

Understand **why workers work**.
An economic approach <u>is most applicable</u> when work becomes a negative. **Marin = Pay - Cost**. Work is a lousy activity with *"pain cost"* and *"opportunity cost"*.

* Opportunism and Shirking. **Principal-Agent Problem** =  Self-Interested workers + Costly monitoring (imperfect information).
* <u>Solution : Incentives.</u> and avoid unintended consequences.
* [HR Pros Ignore Economics at Their Own Peril](https://whitherwork.blogspot.com/2013/12/hr-pros-ignore-economics-at-their-own.html): it is important that HR professionals develop an understanding of basic economics principles and how they apply to HR issues.
* **Information Signals and Screens**

* The Commodification of Work: <u>Label is a special commodity</u>. Labor Market : Labor Supply and Demand - optimization problem to maximize profits.
* Labor as More than a Commodity

# 3. Non-Monetary Aspects of Work

[The Metaphor of the Octopus Worker](https://whitherwork.blogspot.com/2011/12/the-metaphor-of-octopus-worker.html): "When we work, we do more than earn a living, we also create, care for, and serve others. We hopefully derive some satisfaction, but also a deeper understanding of our own identities."


## 3.1 More than money

Self-determination theory. Foundation of intrinsic motivation : **competence, autonomy, relatedness**.

| Job satisfaction | Commitment | Engagement |
|-----|------------|------------|
| Happy | Attached | Invested |

How to facilitate positive work attitudes and fulfillment:

| The job | Co-workers | Managers|
|-----------|--------|----------|
| Skill Variety <br> Task Identity <br> Task Significance <br> Autonomy | Supportive <br> Trusting <br> Belonging | Clear Appropriate Goals with Rational <br> Feedback <br> Career Opportunities |

<p></p>
## 3.2 Identity

Self-Identification by <u>Naming ourselves</u>. define their identities through self-descriptors and by categorizing themselves into groups.
* Social Identity theory - people categorize themselves into groups to enhance self-esteem. emphasis on the positive traits of their in-group compared to out-groups.
* Self-categorization theory - individuals may depersonalize others, viewing them through the lens of group stereotypes rather than as unique individuals.

<h>Creating a shared social identity within teams can enhance performance, as employees internalize group values and norms, fostering a sense of belonging and alignment with organizational goals.</h>

Dark Side : Group Identity could be conflict with someone's inner self.
