| **Questions  (Internal)**                                                 | **Tools**                        |
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| What is the firm's mission and values? What do others expect of the firm? | [Stakeholder Analysis](../3strategy_adv/#l4) |

<p></p>

| Questions (Decision making under uncertainty) | Tools |
| --- | --- |
| How can we best improve our position, i.e. create more value, in our competitive environment? <br> Scaling? Entry? Innovation? Acquisition? | Hypothesis Testing, Payoff Matrices, Real Options Analysis, Acquisition Analysis, Scenario Planning |
| **What strategic actions do we recommend going forward?** | **Strategic Analysis!** |
| What are the underlying assumptions of this recommendation? Does it meet our tests? | Hypothesis Testing |
| How are competitors likely to react to these actions? | [Payoff Matrices](../4strategy_grow/#l3) |
| Does it make sense in future worlds we envision? | [Scenario Planning](../4strategy_grow/#l2) |
| Does it provide strategic flexibility? | [Real Options Analysis](../4strategy_grow/#l5) |
| Does the value created by these actions exceed the opportunity cost? | [Acquisition Analysis](../4strategy_grow/#l4) |

(Prof describes these types of questions, which require a comprehensive and reasonable response in an extremely short period of time, as the highest order of strategic thinking.)

Strategist's Toolkit: **Hypothesis Testing**:
* (1) Frame option as a hypothesis; (2) Identify core assumptions; (3) Conduct thought experiments; (4) Collect data and test assumptions.
* Core Assumptions : (1) Value Test; (2) Execution Test (if is feasible); (3) Scale Test; (4) **Defensibility** Test (can be imitate?).
* Thought experiments : (1) What do you know ? (2) What do you not know, but could? (4) What do you not know, and cann't?
* Related to the thoughts in [The Lean Startup](/Study/PaperRead/company/03leanstartup/).

## 1.2 Strategy Research

* Sources: <u>Annual reports; Analyst and consulting reports; Interviews and surveys; Press releases and news articles; Big data; Taxes, patents, and other publicly required filings. </u>
* Challenges: Little/much/conflicting/proprietary/expensive information. We will never have enough information.
* Devise a research plan. Balance needed and desired data.

# 2. Strategy Formulation & Implementation

## 2.1 Strategy Formulation

Views:
* **Top-Down** : traditional view.
* **Bottom-Up** (Emergent) : emerges over time, response to changing conditions.

**The Strategic War Room** :
* Storyboards. (panels in graphic novel)
* Involvement of organization members. (broad involve of members)
* Involvement of experts.
* Input from diverse perspectives.
* Collaboration.
* Iteration.

**Rapid Prototyping** (manufacturing design build) <u>quickly identify and correct shortcomings in products or organizational changes.</u>
* Encourage different thinking.
* Pilot tests and experiments.
* Quick failures (rapidly determine what works, what doesn't)
* Used in instructional design, Corporate initiates.

**Design Thinking** systematic approach to problem solving. What would be different if managers thought more like designers ? **Empathy, Invention, Iteration**.


|  | BUSINESS | DESIGN |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Underlying Assumptions | Rational and objective; all share the same reality | Emotional and subjective; each have a unique reality |
| Method | Analysis aimed at proving one "best" answer | Experimentation aimed at iterating toward a "better" answer |
| Process | Planning | Doing |
| Decision Drivers | Logic; run the numbers! | Emotional insight: understand experience! |
| Values | Control and stability; discomfort with uncertainty | Pursuing novelty; dislike the status quo |
| Levels of Focus | Strategic or tactical | Back and forth between high level and particular |

**Business Model Canvas** : **Focus, Flexibility, Transparency**: (1) Costumer segments; (2) Value propositions; (3) Channels; (4) Customer relationships; (5) Revenue streams; (6) Key activities; (7) Key resources; (8) Key partnerships; (9) Cost structure.

## 2.2 Corporate Governance

<u>Governance is the way we organize and operate in order to help us accomplish our purpose.</u>
Effective governance boosts performance; minimize misconduct.

* System of checks and balances.
* Set of processes (the "way thins are done").
* Involves the structure of an organization, but more than structure.
* Involves risk management.
* How to deal with external pressures.
* Importance of trust and culture.

Key Themes:
* Long-term orientation.
* Effective stakeholder management.
* Focus on risk management.

## 2.3 The Human Factor

<p></p>
* Behavioral Theory : Bounded (not perfect) rationality; Satisfying (not optimal); Performance assessment (better than benchmark or some reference points).
* Institutional Theory : Mimetic isomorphism (organizations tend to mimic each other).
* Resource Dependence Theory : Power dynamics.


## 2.4 Common Strategy Execution Mistakes
<p></p>
* Failure to understand your own organization.
* Failure to understand how you are performing.
* Failure to understand the context.
* Hyper-focus on growth for growth's sake.
* Governance mismatch.
* Competency traps.

# 3. Strategy Implementation

"Five percent of the challenge is the strategy, Ninety-five percent is the execution." - CEO Nissan/Renalt.

* Goes beyond implementing a plan to include organizational design, culture, processes, technology, and human resource management.
* Is an enduring process, not a single decision or action, and results from a series of integrated decisions and actions over time.
* Requires disciplined investment in four key organizational domains - **The 4A Model of Strategy Execution.**

| | Resources - Human | Resources - Organization |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Energy - Kinetic** | Alignment | Agility |
| **Energy - Potential** | Ability | Architecture |

<p></p>

* Alignment: This involves creating consistency and collaboration within the organization, with a focus on delivering value in the marketplace. It requires all the different components of the organization to align around the strategy and work together to achieve performance.
* Ability: Many organizations lack the necessary talent and leadership to execute a strategy effectively. Developing a strong leadership bench and ensuring a robust talent system are essential for building the skills and abilities needed to execute the strategy.
* Architecture: The infrastructure of an organization, including information systems, processes, reward systems, and organizational structure, plays a vital role in strategy execution. Different strategies may require different architectures, and it is important to build the right platform to support the execution of the strategy.
* Agility: Strategies need to adapt and change over time, and organizations must be agile enough to respond to these changes. Creating a capacity for organizational learning, adaptation, and adjustment is crucial for maintaining agility and ensuring long-term success.

## 3.1 Alignment

* External alignment - organization operates in a manner 'fit for purpose' to support the market strategy.
* Internal alignment - processes, practices, structures work together to create a mutually reinforcing system.
* Leadership alignment - consistency of perspective and effort toward a <u>common strategic intent.</u>

**Keys** to Achieving Alignment
* Clearly articulated strategic intent.
  * There is NOT one best strategy.
  * Treacy & Wiersema
* Shared expectations for high performance.
  * Cultures may reinforce other values.
  * Grounded in practice and initiatives.
* Accountability for results.
  * Drucker: “What gets measured gets done.”
  * Caution: unintended consequences.

**Strategy Mapping.** Metrics & Initiatives.

## 3.2 Ability

The Talent Syndrome: firms often face talent shortages.

**Keys** to Execution Ability
* Identify <u>strategic talent pools</u>
  * Two dimensions : General <-> **Unique**; Operational <-> **Strategic**.
* Develop a <u>robust</u> talent system:
  * Useful and Usable.
  * Mutually reinforcing.
  * Produce Unique & Strategic talents.
* Vitality - build the talent pipeline
  * Commitment Engagement Accountability.
  * Business Perf : Top leaders - Line Managers - Key Talent.

## 3.3 Architecture

Organization Architecture : managing information and authority. Getting the right design.

* Two extremes : (1) Underdeveloped organization (insufficient infrastructure); (2) Bureaucratic organization.
* Design Principles:
  * Strategy "enacts" environment → (complexity + dynamism = uncertainty).
  * Structure helps manage uncertainty and information required to make decisions.
  * Curvilinear relationship between <u>uncertainty and bureaucracy.</u>
* (1) Flatter, simplified structures
  * Enpower decisions close to action - Google to Alphabet.
* (2) Streamlined processes & workflow
  * Eliminate waste & improve value add
* (3) Information access and connectivity
  * "Inform" real-time decisions

## 3.4 Agility

Why is agility so difficult?

- Uncertainty and ambiguity - what makes it difficult, makes it important.
- Inertia versus momentum - flat footed or sprinting.
- Leader adaptability - too slow or too fast.
- Culture of risk aversion - avoid falling into the execution trap.

<img style="float: right;" src="/assets/img/company/agility_1.jpg" width="35%"/>

Keys :
1. Organizational Learning. (see right image)
2. Leadership unity. <u>Transactive memory</u> : A knowledge system shared by a group, in which each member of the group has a known area of expertise.
3. Resource fluidity. Adjustable, and could reallocated.
