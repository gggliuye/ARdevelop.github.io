# 1. Strategic Analysis

## 1.1 Four Steps

1. Identify Mission and Values.
2. Analyze the Competitive Environment.
3. Analyze Competitive Position.
4. Analyze and Recommend Strategic Actions.

| **Questions (External)**                                           | **Tools**                        |
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| What market(s) is the firm in and who are the players in these markets?   | Competitor Analysis              |
| What are the major trends impacting the industry?                        | Environmental Analysis           |
| Is this an attractive market? Are there barriers to competition?         | [Five Forces Analysis](../2strategy/#l2)             |
| How is the competitive structure of the market likely to evolve?         | [Competitive Life Cycle Analysis](../3strategy_adv/#l1)  |

| **Questions  (Internal)**                                                 | **Tools**                        |
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| What is the firm's mission and values? What do others expect of the firm? | [Stakeholder Analysis](../3strategy_adv/#l4) |
| What are the firm's unique resources and capabilities? How sustainable is any advantage from these assets? | [Capabilities Analysis](../2strategy/#l3) |
| Can the firm leverage these assets across markets so as to improve their position in a market? | Portfolio Planning Matrices |
| How should the firm position itself in the market relative to its rivals? | Strategic Maps |

| Questions (Decision making under uncertainty) | Tools |
| --- | --- |
| How can we best improve our position, i.e. create more value, in our competitive environment? <br> Scaling? Entry? Innovation? Acquisition? | Hypothesis Testing, Payoff Matrices, Real Options Analysis, Acquisition Analysis, Scenario Planning |
| **What strategic actions do we recommend going forward?** | **Strategic Analysis!** |
| What are the underlying assumptions of this recommendation? Does it meet our tests? | Hypothesis Testing |
| How are competitors likely to react to these actions? | [Payoff Matrices](../4strategy_grow/#l3) |
| Does it make sense in future worlds we envision? | [Scenario Planning](../4strategy_grow/#l2) |
| Does it provide strategic flexibility? | [Real Options Analysis](../4strategy_grow/#l5) |
| Does the value created by these actions exceed the opportunity cost? | [Acquisition Analysis](../4strategy_grow/#l4) |

(Prof describes these types of questions, which require a comprehensive and reasonable response in an extremely short period of time, as the highest order of strategic thinking.)

Strategist's Toolkit: **Hypothesis Testing**:
* (1) Frame option as a hypothesis; (2) Identify core assumptions; (3) Conduct thought experiments; (4) Collect data and test assumptions.
* Core Assumptions : (1) Value Test; (2) Execution Test (if is feasible); (3) Scale Test; (4) **Defensibility** Test (can be imitate?).
* Thought experiments : (1) What do you know ? (2) What do you not know, but could? (4) What do you not know, and cann't?
* Related to the thoughts in [The Lean Startup](/Study/PaperRead/company/03leanstartup/).

## 1.2 Strategy Research

* Sources: <u>Annual reports; Analyst and consulting reports; Interviews and surveys; Press releases and news articles; Big data; Taxes, patents, and other publicly required filings. </u>
* Challenges: Little/much/conflicting/proprietary/expensive information. We will never have enough information.
* Devise a research plan. Balance needed and desired data.

## 1.3 Strategy Analytics


### Industry Structure Measures
1. **Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR)** - Measures the rate at which an industry grows over time.
2. **Elasticity of Demand** - Refers to the sensitivity of customers within a given market to price changes.
3. **Cross Price Elasticity** - Refers to the sensitivity of the price of one product to the price of another, used to consider the threat of substitutes within an industry.
4. **Concentration within the Industry**
   - **Concentration Ratio (CR4)** - A measure of the market share of the four largest firms in an industry.
   - **Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI)** - The sum of the squares of market shares within an industry, used to measure market concentration.
5. **Economies of Scale** - Understanding how large-scale production releases costs within the industry, often calculated using cost data and regression analysis.

### Financial Performance Measures
1. **Profitability**
   - **Earnings Before Interest and Taxes (EBIT)** - A measure of earnings before interest and taxes are accounted for.
2. **Return Ratios**
   - **Return on Assets (ROA)**
   - **Return on Equity (ROE)**
   - **Return on Sales (ROS)**
3. **Price Earnings Ratio** - The ratio of a firm's current share price to its per-share earnings.
4. **Discounted Cash Flows (DCF)** - A valuation method that estimates the attractiveness of an investment opportunity.
5. **Market to Book Ratio** - Compares a firm's market value to its book value.
6. **Tobin's Q** - A measure that replaces the book value with the replacement value of assets to reflect market expectations versus the current position of an organization.

### Organizational Performance Measures
1. **Revenues** - The income generated from the sale of goods or services.
2. **Costs** - Such as cost of goods sold.
3. **Growth** - Both top-line (revenue) and bottom-line (profit) growth within the company.
4. **Market Share** - A metric for the success of the organization.
5. **Leverage** - The degree to which a company has taken on debt.
6. **Turnover** - The rate at which employees are leaving the company, which can indicate the company's ability to retain talent.
7. **R&D Intensity** - R&D expenditures divided by sales, indicating the company's strategic direction towards innovation.
8. **Advertising Intensity** - Advertising expenditures divided by sales, indicating the company's strategic direction towards marketing.

### Inference Tools
1. **Five Forces Analysis** - Analyzes the competitive intensity of an industry.
2. **Capabilities Analysis** - Assesses the capabilities of a company.
3. **Break-even Analysis** - Determines the sales volume needed to cover all costs.
4. **Decision Trees** - Evaluates the payoffs associated with different strategic options.
5. **Sensitivity Analysis**
   - **Tornado Charts**
   - **Monte Carlo Simulation**
6. **Regression Analysis** - Identifies relationships between sets of data.
7. **Data Visualization** - Techniques and tools to help visualize data for making inferences and recommendations.
