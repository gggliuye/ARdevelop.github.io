# 1. Introduction

The basics of financial markets, insurance, and CAPM (Capital Asset Pricing Model).

**Financial institutions** are a pillar of civilized society, <u>directing resources across space and time to their best uses, supporting and incentivizing people in their productive ventures,</u> and managing the economic **risks** they take on. The workings of these institutions are important to comprehend if we are to predict their actions today and their evolution in the coming information age.


* **VaR** variance and “value at risk” (for describing portfolio)
  * 1% one-year VaR of 10 million means 1% chance that a portfolio will lose 10 million in a year.
* **Stress Test** usually organized by governement, to see how some firm will stand up to a financial crisis. A method of accessing risks to firms or portfolios.
  * ["The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dodd%E2%80%93Frank_Wall_Street_Reform_and_Consumer_Protection_Act) in response to 2007-2008 crisis.
  * Economic **scenarios analysis**: tries to incorporate all potential economic and financial crises, such as recessions, appreciation and depreciation of currency, liquidity crisis, etc.
  * It is inadequate.
* **S&P 500** (Standard & Poor's 500 stock price index ) used as a benchmark for returns.
  * **Correlation** of individual company and the market.
  * **Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM)**. $StockRisk = \beta^{2} SystematicRisk + IdiosyncraticRisk $
    * low beta - safe.
    * negative beta : gold.
* **Distribution & Outliers**
  * Normal distribution. Cauchy distribution with **fat tails** (exhibits a large skewness or kurtosis).
  * On October 19, 1987 the stock market fell 20.47 percent in one day.

## 1.1 Insurance

Deal with Risk - **Insurance**：
* Problems facing by insurance companies:
  * **Risk Pooling**（风险池化）the source of all value in insurance.
    * 通过将多个独立的风险（如不同地区或客户的需求波动、供应链中不同供应商的风险等）组合在一起，从而减少整体风险的不确定性和波动性。
  * **Moral Hazard** dealt with partially by deductions and coinsurance.
    * 一个人或机构可以在行为上做出选择而无需承担这些行为的全部后果时，从而导致不良（高风险）行为增加。信息不对称，风险转移，行为变化。
  * **Selection Bias** dealt with by group policies, by testing and referrals, and by mandatory government insurance.
    * 保险公司的评估可能面临选择偏差。
  * Example : weather insurance, the definition is vital.
* Insurance Milestones.
* Insurance is a Local Phenomenon (in US). US's insurance system is complicated.
  * If insurance company failed. Gov tends to bail it out,
  * The China Insurance Regulatory Commission.
* Health Insurance in US.
  * U.S. has had something like 45 million people uninsured. US health insurance is private, and it's often through employers.
    * Has high charge rate (for health people).
    * Caused by selection bias (the people who sign up for insurance are the people who know they're sick and need it. )
  * U.S. Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act 2010 (**Obamacare**)
    * Try to deal with selection bias problem by forcing everyone to sign up (or else face a tax penalty).
* Disasters:
  * Flood Insurance. to discourage building house in designated high-risk area.
  * Terrorism risks. US force insurance companies to offer against terrorism (while gov pays 90%).
    * Governments need to involve sometimes.

## 1.2 Portfolio

Deal with Risk - **Portfolio Management**
* Portfolio Diversification. (Don't put all eggs in One Basket)
  * **CAPM** : *asserts* that all investors hold their optimal (tangency) portfolio, as a result <u>the tangency portfolio equals the market portfolio.</u>
  * return $r_{i} = r_{f} + \beta_{i}(r_{market} - r_{risk free rate})$
* Investment Companies as Providers of Diversification
  * Since it is difficult for individual people.
  * Investment trusts; Mutual funds; Closed end investment companies; Unit investment trusts.
* **Equity Premium Puzzle** (3.9% over 200 years) we should invest all in stocks ?
  * The average return on stocks has been significantly higher than the return on risk-free assets (such as government bonds), by a margin that is much larger than can be explained by standard economic theories.
  * Equity Premium = Expected Return on Stocks − Risk-Free Rate.
  * answer : US equity premium may reflect a selection bias.
* **Short Sales**
  * Brokers can enable you to hold <u>a negative quantity of a tradable asset</u>.
  * It won't happen with ideal tangency portfolio. (since every one will short a stock at the same time)
* Calculating the **Optimal Portfolio**.
* **Efficient Portfolio Frontier**. risk - return graph.
  * Limitations and Assumptions: (1) Dependence on Historical Data for returns and risks; (2) Market Efficiency Assumption; (3) Normal Distribution of Returns.
* **Gordon Growth Model**
  * To determine the intrinsic value of a stock, based on the present value of its expected future dividends.
  * $P = \frac{X}{r - g} = \frac{X}{1+r} + \frac{X(1+g)}{(1+r)^{2}} + ...$
    * P: present price of the stock.
    * X: The expected dividend (股利) in the next period (usually one year).
    * r: The required rate of return (or discount rate) for the investor.
    * g: The constant growth rate of the dividend per year.
  * Assumptions: (1) Dividends Grow at a Constant Rate; (2) r > g; (3) Stable Business.
  * Limitations: Fit only stable, mature companies with predictable growth rates. <u>While the world is changing very fast.</u>

## 1.3 Others

**Q&A**:
* Hedge Found, more a private thing ~ family office.
* Avoid systemic crisis. more macro-credential regulation and more measures of risk.
* Black Swan, that talked about rare, low-probably events as being sometimes really big. (e.g. house prices)
  * find subtle evidence.
* Hedging against the <u>labor market risks</u>:
  * Unemployment insurance
  * Livelihood (wage) insurance (for wage decrease). if you help people, people will take more risk (<n>to a make better world</n>).

**Philanthropy Capitalism**（慈善资本主义）是一种将资本主义的市场驱动力与慈善事业结合在一起的理念。它主张通过商业手段和市场机制来解决社会问题，而不仅仅依靠传统的慈善捐赠或政府干预。这种模式认为，企业和富有的个人可以利用他们的资源、创新能力和市场力量，在追求盈利的同时，也能对社会产生积极的影响。
* 特点：（1）盈利与社会影响；（2）市场驱动；（3）可持续性。
* 实践：（1）Impact Investing；（2）社会企业；（3）企业社会责任（CSR）。
* 批评：（1）效力与规模—难以覆盖脆弱和贫困群体；（2）利益冲突导致社会目标被牺牲；（3）社会责任的转移。
