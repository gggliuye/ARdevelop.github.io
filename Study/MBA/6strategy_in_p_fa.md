title: Strategy - Mixed Reality in vehicles
subtitle: Final Assignment of Business Strategy in Practice
---

Our company are building Mixed Reality experience for drivers and passengers in a vehicles.

* We have two major scenarios:
  1. Augmented Reality Glass system for drivers.
    * See thought the blind area for drivers, to be more safe.
    * AR navigation assistant, to help driver better driving.
  2. Car Meta-Verse experience for passengers to enjoy Virtual Reality.
* We have been cooperate with a hardware company. We build the software based on their devices.
* Our software includes :
  * Car localization system, offering high frequency 6dof car poses.
  * MR localization with respect to the move car, offering 6dof poses of the MR glasses.

## Environment Analysis

Current market is growing:
* The market of Virtual Reality and Augmented Reality is growing. The market is 3 billons in US. A Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of over 40% between 2024 and 2036 is suggested [^grow].
  * In 2023, China's AR market shipments will reach 262,000 units, a year-on-year increase of 154.4% [^argrow].
  * But most growth are in VR and AI assistant AR. Not in real augmented reality glasses.
* The market of Car is stable, and large. The projected revenue reaches US$549.9bn in China. With an annual growth rate (CAGR 2024-2028) of 1.07% anticipated [^carg].


Current Augmented Reality Glass in car market (no company is making augmented reality experiences for driver thought AR glasses) :
* I have made a research in [the history of MR in car](/2024-09-11-vr-car/).
* Meta had been developing AR glass in car since 2022. But no further product information since [then](https://about.fb.com/news/2023/05/meta-bmw-ar-vr-experiences/).
  * Meta's new [AR glasses](https://www.meta.com/smart-glasses/) focus only on AI assistant (not on augmented reality experiences).
  * Meta's new travel mode, seems remove the dependence on car. While Meta never give publicity to application in a moving vehicle. Make us curious about their attitude towards this market.
  * Meta has just release their [true AR glasses - Orion](https://about.fb.com/news/2024/09/introducing-orion-our-first-true-augmented-reality-glasses/), this will be a trough technological barrier.
* This market is still in **Ferment period** (in Competitive Life Circle).

Can the market grow further? Not cue! Do consumers like AR glasses in vehicles for driving assisting ? Not yet.

## Five Forces Analysis

<p></p>

1. (=) Threat of Entry. Hard to entry.
  * High sunk costs - MR glass is a very complicated system. The major technology barrier is about the lens, which cannot be used elsewhere.
  * Meta might build great competitive advantage.
2. Threat of Substitutes.
  * (-) AR glasses user cases : We have only a few user cases, and they can be easily substituted by VR/MR glasses.
  * (+) For VR metaverse user case : we are unique!
3. (=) Bargaining Power of Buyers. We are unique, but we are not attractive enough, our functions are not necessary for a vehicle.
4. (-) Bargaining Power of Suppliers. They could develop the user cases with their own group.
5. Intensity of Rivalry.
  * (+) AR: No large company, since the current market size is small.
  * (-) VR: Meta took a large majority of the market share.

## Stakeholder Analysis

We have communicated with various stakeholders. They are interested in different fields.

|     | Safety |  Price | Comfort | Function | Summary |
| Consumers | ++ | ++ | ++ | ++ |  every thing is important |
| Governments | ++ | = | = | = | safety need to be ensured |
| MR Provider | = | ++ | = | = | want to sell more devices |
| Automotive Company | + | ++ | + | ++ | want to involve high-tech, want to sell more cars |

## Competitive Position - AR

Current market problems :

* Augmented Reality glasses sure is a cool thing, while it might need more time than we thought. (the current [lens technologies](/2024-07-26-ar/) cannot reach our anticipation - in FOV, weight, duration, etc).
* Do driver need AR glasses ? Since HUD and digital screens might satisfy all needs.
* Can (or should) driver wear AR glasses ? Since it might be dangerous, it might cause damage when car accidents, or it may distract the drivers.

As a result, in order to occupy a better position in this market, we need to overcome these problems, and be in a leading position at least for one of the fields. Let's consider these problems :
1. (x) Develop a better visual effect. While we are not a hardware company, without technology bases.
  * We could build a tight cooperation with a hardware company to overcome our shortage here.
2. Find a **better user case** (that HUDs or digital screens cannot realize). Better understanding the consumers.
3. We need to be both **comfortable and safe**.

## Competitive Position - VR

Current market problems :
* customers are not willing to wear VR glasses in vehicle, this idea is not yet attractive for them.
* Hardware company could extend their capability to push us out. But the connection with vehicle dynamic has technological barrier.

To over come the problem :
1. Consumer Education is vital (even it is very hard).
2. Further develop our technology in the connection of MR and car.
