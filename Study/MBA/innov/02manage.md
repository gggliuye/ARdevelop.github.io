# 1. Managing Innovation

1. Reviewing key characteristics of new technologies and markets.
2. How uncertainty, among other such characteristics, fundamentally affects management and execution of innovation initiatives.
3. Managing innovation initiatives in firms which confront new technologies and markets while they simultaneously compete in established businesses - **organizational ambidexterity**.

## 1.1 Challenges in the Evolution of New Technologies and Markets

Young markets are :
(1) **Uncertain** - Clarity is lacking about future success. direction, growth.
(2) **Dynamic** - Rapidly changing and developing

<u>Strategic choices (Conventional Wisdom):</u>
* Timing of entry.
* Magnitude of commitment.
* Link to or separate from existing organization.
* Strategic Approach : How to compete?

## 1.2 How Organizations Succeed and Fail as Markets Grow and Change

How do we implement a strategy effectively?
**Alignment** - Design the organization around that strategy.


* **Strategy** (key success factors : critical tasks that we need to succeed at)
* **Structure & Systems** (Functional structures vs. divisions/business units; Centralization vs decentralization; Measurements & rewards)
* **People** (who to hire? Competencies? How to motivate?)
* **Culture** (Shared expectations on what and how things work)

**Inertia** over time, as alignment and fit improve, we build more inertia. It takes more and more energy to change alignment.
**(1) Structure Inertia** (actively try to preserve structure elements); **(2) Cultural Inertia** (actively preserve organizational beliefs)

## 1.3 Ambidextrous Organizations

* one hand : compete in **mainstream market**.
* other hand : develop **new products & enter new markets**.

Mainstream tends to **UNDERMINING** of new business:
* Resources:
  * Established business has voracious appetite for resources.
  * Mainstream business can point to relatively certain losses if it doesn't receive resources, while new business can only point to uncertain gains if it does.
  * Mainstream business will have more executive who are also more powerful and credible.
* New business can appear as a problem, not a solution.
  * May threaten existing one (cannibalization).
  * May be a distraction from existing one.
* Inertia : mainstream business will hinder efforts to design a new organization. which needs different structures, systems, rewards, culture,that can execute the new-business strategy.

Form numerous, semi-autonomous small units to gain responsiveness & innovation.
We need **separation** and **integration** (Enable differential alignment through separation but still maintain some integration).

## 1.4 Leading Ambidextrous Organizations

Establish a strategic intent & identity that :
* Makes clear the need for success in the existing businesses as well as the new businesses.
* Validates the need for experimentation & innovation.

Leaders can adopt one of three approaches: <u>the leader does it (hub and spoke model), the team does it (collaborative leadership)</u>, or team members do it (delegated responsibility). The first two are more effective than the third. It's crucial to consciously choose an approach and be adaptable as the organization evolves.

Key leadership challenges:
1. Engage and explain the intent and identity that connect innovation and mainstream efforts to foster understanding and buy-in.
2. Resolve tensions and conflicts that arise between innovation and established business units, creating forums for discussion and resolution.
3. Acknowledge and manage inconsistencies between the two types of units, treating them differently based on their unique goals and evaluations.
4. Allocate time and resources to address these leadership tasks, ensuring that discussions about interconnections are prioritized.

# 2. Responding to Different Types of Innovations

## 2.1 Disruptive Technologies

Types of Innovations
* Disruptive technologies are innovations that initially do not meet the needs of existing customers but eventually disrupt the market by appealing to new customer segments.
* Sustaining technologies, on the other hand, are those that improve existing products and meet the demands of current customers, ensuring that established firms can maintain their market position.

The Dynamics of Disruption
* Established firms often struggle to respond to disruptive technologies because they focus on satisfying their existing customers, which can lead them to overlook emerging market opportunities.
* The example of the disk drive industry illustrates how smaller, disruptive technologies can develop a separate market trajectory before eventually intersecting with the needs of mainstream customers, leading to disruption.

## 2.2 Responding to Disruptive Technologies

Understanding the Challenges
- Incumbent firms often recognize new technologies but fail to pursue them vigorously due to a focus on existing customers and their needs.
- Resource allocation systems prioritize larger, more certain markets, leading to neglect of emerging, lower-margin opportunities.

**Response effectively:**
1. <u>Recognize possibility that new technology can be disruptive.</u> (ask right people)
2. <u>Ask about feasible market-technology intersections.</u>
3. <u>Locate the initial market.</u> (use non-traditional means rather than traditional channels)

Strategies for Effective Response
- Firms should adopt a new perspective by engaging with engineers and technologists to evaluate the potential of disruptive technologies.
- Establishing independent organizations can foster flexibility and innovation, allowing firms to explore new markets without the constraints of traditional management structures.

Connecting to Ambidexterity
- The concepts of disruptive technology and ambidexterity complement each other, highlighting the need for different strategies to manage innovation effectively.
- Recognizing the distinction between new markets as opportunities versus threats is crucial for navigating internal political dynamics and ensuring organizational alignment.

## 2.3 Effective Management of Innovation Streams


**Capabilities** : something an organization can do well.
* **Resources** : tangible & intangible valuable assets; people, equipment, product designs, brands, customer, supplier relationships, etc.
* **Processes**: how in the organization, people make things done. Exist in all functions. Processes create inertia.
* **Values** : (1) The 'Software' of the organization; (2) values about what gross margins are acceptable; (3) what size the business needs to be to be interesting.

**Building Capabilities**: <h>(1) Independent organization. (2) Heavyweight team. (3) Acquisitions.</h>

## 2.4 Corporate Entrepreneurship

Corporate Entrepreneurship: <u>Firm relies on & enables employees to build new businesses that leverage resources of the parent firm</u> (happens within the firm, leverage the resources within the firm). Extend the range of tools we have for building an innovative firm.
