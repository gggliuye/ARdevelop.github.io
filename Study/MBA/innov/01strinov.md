# 1. Innovation Life Cycles

Key drivers of innovation life cycles:
1. The rate or trajectory of technological advance - S-curves (cumulative adaptation).
2. Firm's decisions of when to enter the market.
3. Customers decisions of when to adopt new technologies.


## 1.1 Readings

üëç [Crossing the chasm: Marketing and selling technology products to mainstream customers 1991](http://soloway.pbworks.com/w/file/fetch/46715502/Crossing-The-Chasm.pdf). Moore identifies **a perilous gap**, or "chasm," that many high-tech products fall into when attempting this transition. Strategies for successfully transitioning products to the mainstream market, including <u>focusing on a specific niche market and concentrating resources on becoming the dominant player in that segment.</u>

üëë [Eager Sellers and Stony Buyers: Understanding the Psychology of New-Product Adoption 2006](https://hbr.org/2006/06/eager-sellers-and-stony-buyers-understanding-the-psychology-of-new-product-adoption)
* **The Psychology of Gains and Losses** - why individuals deviate from rational economic behavior:
  1. people evaluate the attractiveness of an alternative based not on its objective, or actual, value but on its <u>subjective, or perceived, value.</u>
  2. consumers evaluate new products or investments <u>relative to a reference point</u>, usually the products they already own or consume.
  3. people view any improvements relative to this reference point as gains and treat all shortcomings as losses.
  4. **loss aversion** : losses have a far greater impact on people than similarly sized gains.
* **The endowment effect** (**Status quo bias**): Loss aversion leads people to <u>value products that they already possess‚Äîthose that are part of their endowment‚Äîmore than those they don‚Äôt have.</u>
* **Fail**: <u>Executives, who irrationally overvalue their innovations, must predict the buying behavior of consumers, who irrationally overvalue existing alternatives.</u>
* **Behavioral Framework** (built by author) : <u>the new product ortechnology itself, the consumer who must adopt it, and the company that designs it.</u>
  * Innovations and behavior change.
  * Consumers and behavior change.
  * Companies and behavior change. (‚Äúcurse of knowledge,‚Äù)

> Some innovations offer great benefits but require minimal
behavior change. These products stand the best chance of both
short-term and long-term success.

* Accepting Resistance: Be patient. Eliminate the old.
* Minimizing Resistance: Make behaviorally compatible products. Seek out the unendowed. Find believers.

## 1.2 Lifecycles

**Diffusion of firms**: <u>firm takeoff and sales takeoff points</u>. Firm takeoff usually come before sales takeoff.

**Product life cycle** ([Reading](https://www.twi-global.com/technical-knowledge/faqs/what-is-a-product-life-cycle)), takeoff point as the sales takeoff.

## 1.3 Types of Innovations

* Process
* Incremental
* Radical
* Disruptive (initial bad, gradually getting better )
* Business Model

## 1.4 Crossing Over from Niche Markets to Mass-Market Dominance

* Early market, MVP (~alpha/beta product) is OK.
* Find a niche. <u>NEED A PERFECT PRODUCT</u>. Companies need to identify a **beachhead segment** and develop a perfect product for that segment.
* (To Mass-Market) Generate volumes and harness cost advantages so as to develop reliable products.

# 2. Disruptive Innovation

How innovating entrants can disrupt industry leaders

## 2.1 Readings

[Match Your Innovation Strategy to Your Innovation Ecosystem 2006](https://hbr.org/2006/04/match-your-innovation-strategy-to-your-innovation-ecosystem)
> When they work, ecosystems allow firms to create value that no single firm could create alone.

* Innovation ecosystems are characterized by three fundamental types of risk:
  1. initiative risks, or the familiar uncertainties of managing a project.
  2. interdependence risks, or the <u>uncertainties of coordinating with complementary innovators</u>.
    * different partners should be able to satisfy their commitments within a specific time frame.
    * other ecosystem actors had to develop their own distinct innovations.
  3. integration risks, or the uncertainties presented by the adoption process across the value chain.
    * Innovation adopt it to old value chain before it can reach volume sales.
* Target Markets and Ecosystem Risk
* <u>Strategy in Ecosystems</u>:
  1. Where to compete.
  2. When to compete.
  3. How to compete.

## 2.2 Demand-Side Disruption

* What makes a disruption a disruption is not the original starting point, but how the trajectory improves over time.
* Two types:
  * The low-end disruptor, targeting the underserved segments by offering a lower quality product at that point in time.
  * The new to the market disruption, they come in with a totally different package of attributes and catered to the non-served market.
