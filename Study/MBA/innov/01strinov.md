üëç [Crossing the chasm: Marketing and selling technology products to mainstream customers 1991](http://soloway.pbworks.com/w/file/fetch/46715502/Crossing-The-Chasm.pdf). Moore identifies **a perilous gap**, or "chasm," that many high-tech products fall into when attempting this transition. Strategies for successfully transitioning products to the mainstream market, including <u>focusing on a specific niche market and concentrating resources on becoming the dominant player in that segment.</u>

üëë [Eager Sellers and Stony Buyers: Understanding the Psychology of New-Product Adoption 2006](https://hbr.org/2006/06/eager-sellers-and-stony-buyers-understanding-the-psychology-of-new-product-adoption)
* **The Psychology of Gains and Losses** - why individuals deviate from rational economic behavior:
  1. people evaluate the attractiveness of an alternative based not on its objective, or actual, value but on its <u>subjective, or perceived, value.</u>
  2. consumers evaluate new products or investments <u>relative to a reference point</u>, usually the products they already own or consume.
  3. people view any improvements relative to this reference point as gains and treat all shortcomings as losses.
  4. **loss aversion** : losses have a far greater impact on people than similarly sized gains.
* **The endowment effect** (**Status quo bias**): Loss aversion leads people to <u>value products that they already possess‚Äîthose that are part of their endowment‚Äîmore than those they don‚Äôt have.</u>
* **Fail**: <u>Executives, who irrationally overvalue their innovations, must predict the buying behavior of consumers, who irrationally overvalue existing alternatives.</u>
* **Behavioral Framework** (built by author) : <u>the new product ortechnology itself, the consumer who must adopt it, and the company that designs it.</u>
  * Innovations and behavior change.
  * Consumers and behavior change.
  * Companies and behavior change. (‚Äúcurse of knowledge,‚Äù)

> Some innovations offer great benefits but require minimal
behavior change. These products stand the best chance of both
short-term and long-term success.

* Accepting Resistance: Be patient. Eliminate the old.
* Minimizing Resistance: Make behaviorally compatible products. Seek out the unendowed. Find believers.
