# 1. Earning Revenue

<u>The difference between a startup concept and a startup business is paying customers.</u>

## 1.1 Go-To-Market Strategy

* [Leslie’s Compass: A Framework For Go-To-Market Strategy](https://review.firstround.com/leslies-compass-a-framework-for-go-to-market-strategy/) marketing and sales are counterbalances: <u>If you’re marketing-intensive, the product is bought. If it’s sales-intensive, the product is sold.</u>
  * Use 7 factors : <u>Price, Market Size, Complexity, Fit, Customer, Relationship, Touch, </u> to determine <u>whether you have a sales-intensive or marketing-intensive product</u>.
