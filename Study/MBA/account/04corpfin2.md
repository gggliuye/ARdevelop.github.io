# 1. Market Efficiency

1. Market price = Intrinsic value.
2. Price predictability - No ability to successfully/consistently forecast prices.
  * All known information is incorporated in prices.
  * Only new (unknown, unpredictable) information affects prices.

Market Efficiency is an "extreme hypothesis" - an ideal state, not strictly achievable.
Market Efficiency applies to markets and companies.

## 1.1 Market Efficiency Levels

1. **Weak-form efficiency**: Prices reflect all past trading information.
2. **Semi-strong form efficiency**: Prices reflect all publicly available information, including financial reports and macroeconomic data.
3. **Strong form efficiency**: Prices reflect all information, both public and private.

## 1.2 Fundamental and Technical Analysis

* **Fundamental analysis** (by analysis the company and market) : <u>long-term oriented</u>, produces long-term valuation (not timing) signals.
* **Technical analysis** (focus on data) : <u>short-term oriented</u>, produces short-term timing (not valuation) signals.
  * The more efficient the market is the less effective the technical analysis will be.

## 1.3 Some Points

1. Careful with **Overfitting** on history data.
2. **Correlation** does not imply **Causation**.
3. Careful with **Backtesting**.
4. Successful strategies are self-defeating - Market Competition.

## 1.4 Beat the Market

Beating the market is <u>obtaining a higher risk-adjusted return than the market consistently over time</u> - **very hard to maintain in the long term**.

## 1.5 Investing

* Active management : require advance tech and more effort, to beat the market.
  * Mutual funds.
* Passive management : to keep with market return.
  * Index funds / EFTs.

# 2. Bonds

**Bonds** (债券) are <u>contracts between a borrower and a lender, specifying the terms of borrowing, including the amount borrowed (principal or face value), interest rate (coupon), and maturity date.</u>
* **Indenture** is the contract that outlines these terms.
* **Principal** (Face Value) is the nominal amount that will be repaid at maturity.
* **Coupon** (Interest Rate) refers to the interest payments made to the bondholder, typically expressed as a percentage of the principal.
* Types:
  * **Coupon Bonds**: Pay periodic interest until maturity.
    * $V_{0} = \frac{C}{(1+R)} + \frac{C}{(1+R)^{2}} + ... + \frac{C + P}{(1+R)^{T}}$ (to compute V0)
    * $p_{0} = \frac{C}{(1+YTM)} + \frac{C}{(1+YTM)^{2}} + ... + \frac{C + P}{(1+YTM)^{T}}$ (to compute YTM)
  * **Zero-Coupon Bonds**: Do not pay interest but are sold at a discount and repay the face value at maturity.
    * $V_{0} = \frac{P}{(1+R)^{T}}$
  * **Perpetual Bonds** (Consols) : Pay interest indefinitely without repaying the principal.
    * $V_{0} = \frac{C}{(1+R)} + \frac{C}{(1+R)^{2}} + ... = \frac{C}{R}$
* **Discount Rate** (折现率) of Bonds : $R = R_{f} + RP$ ([see former course](../03corpfin/#l3))
  * RP : risk premium (default risk, interest rate risk, and liquidity risk)
* **Yield to Maturity** (YTM 到期收益率) annualized return from buying a bond at its market price and holding it until maturity. ([see former course](../03corpfin/#l4))
* **Risk**:
  * **Default (credit) Risk** - <u>Credit rating agencies</u>: Standard & Poor's / Moody's / Fitch / ...
    * Relevant variables : <u>(1) Debt ratio = Debt / (Debt + Equity); (2) Interest coverage  = EBIT/Interest.</u>
  * <u>Interest-rate (market) risk</u>: Longer maturity bonds tend to have higher price volatility.
  * <u>Liquidity risk</u>: The ease of buying or selling a bond at market price; well-known bonds are more liquid.
  * <u>Sovereign Risk</u>: The reliability of different countries in terms of default risk.
  * <u>Currency Risk</u>: Exposure to exchange rate fluctuations when investing in bonds priced in different currencies.
