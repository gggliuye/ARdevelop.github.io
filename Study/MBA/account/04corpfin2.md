# 1. Market Efficiency

1. Market price = Intrinsic value.
2. Price predictability - No ability to successfully/consistently forecast prices.
  * All known information is incorporated in prices.
  * Only new (unknown, unpredictable) information affects prices.

Market Efficiency is an "extreme hypothesis" - an ideal state, not strictly achievable.
Market Efficiency applies to markets and companies.

## 1.1 Market Efficiency Levels

1. **Weak-form efficiency**: Prices reflect all past trading information.
2. **Semi-strong form efficiency**: Prices reflect all publicly available information, including financial reports and macroeconomic data.
3. **Strong form efficiency**: Prices reflect all information, both public and private.

## 1.2 Fundamental and Technical Analysis

* **Fundamental analysis** (by analysis the company and market) : <u>long-term oriented</u>, produces long-term valuation (not timing) signals.
* **Technical analysis** (focus on data) : <u>short-term oriented</u>, produces short-term timing (not valuation) signals.
  * The more efficient the market is the less effective the technical analysis will be.

## 1.3 Some Points

1. Careful with **Overfitting** on history data.
2. **Correlation** does not imply **Causation**.
3. Careful with **Backtesting**.
4. Successful strategies are self-defeating - Market Competition.

## 1.4 Beat the Market

Beating the market is <u>obtaining a higher risk-adjusted return than the market consistently over time</u> - **very hard to maintain in the long term**.

## 1.5 Investing

* Active management : require advance tech and more effort, to beat the market.
  * Mutual funds.
* Passive management : to keep with market return.
  * Index funds / EFTs.
