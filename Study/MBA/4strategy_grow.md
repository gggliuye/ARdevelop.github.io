# 1. Growth Strategy Overview

Why Grow ? **To Create Value!** <u>Growth is not always imperative. Growth can be risky.</u>
* Pressure to grow (media, analysts, etc)
* Growth = more profits **?** (not guaranteed)
* Growth = EOS(economies of scale)/efficiency = profits **?** (not guaranteed)
* Growth = more market share = profits **?** (not guaranteed)

# 2. Growth through Scaling

Scaling is a way for a business to grow by <u>doing more of what they're already doing</u>, which increases revenue without increasing costs.

1. Identify a "high growth potential" market segment.
  * Competitor, environment, industry, life-circle, **competitive position**.
2. Formulate a plan that is robust to different scenarios.
  * Capabilities, Stakeholder, Internationalization, Diversification.

**Scenario Planning**. Scenario planning encourages strategists to step outside their assumptions about the future and question them. Businesses can better prepare for uncertainties and make more informed strategic decisions.

1. Identifies future factors as <u>trends and uncertainties</u>.
2. Then employ uncertainties to generate multiple scenarios of the future.
3. Contingency planning for multiple possible futures.
4. Structures our analytical thinking about these uncertain futures.
5. "Stress test" for our strategy.

(1) Identify **key strategic issue** - important strategic decision with large potential impact.

(2) Identify **key trends and uncertainties**.

(3) **Construct scenarios**. select two most important uncertainty then plot.

|   | Uncertainty YZ <br> Outcome Y | Uncertainty YZ <br> Outcome Z|
|Uncertainty XW <br> Outcome X| Scenario A | Scenario B |
|Uncertainty XW <br> Outcome W| Scenario C | Scenario D |

(4) **Write your scenarios**. visualize and vividly describe the scenarios, with details.

(5) **Reflect on current strategy**. Examine robustness of strategy across the different scenarios.

# 3. Entry and Rivalry

(Five Forces analysis; Competitor analysis; Game-theoretic analysis.)

**Game Theory** - "the formal analysis of conflict and cooperation among intelligent and rational decision makers." **Look forward and reason backwards!**
* The Prisoner's Dilemma - Cheap talk and costly action - Signaling, Commitment.
* Identifying Potential Rivals : "outside" firms with economic motivations. Firms that share a value chain with you or are in the same vertical industry chain.

(1) Pre-entry strategies:
* **Deterrence strategies.**
  * Increase the cost and risk of entry: structural barriers reducing the quality of information on costs and demand, or hiding underlying capabilities.
  * Retaliation strategies. Reduce the incentive to enter: raise factor costs (要素成本), limit pricing.
* **Accommodation strategies.** accommodate entry if deterrence is too costly.
  * commit to position, that could soften competition after entry.
  * Make commitments limiting your ability or incentives to compete aggressively.
  * Organize to facilitate future coordination.

(2) Post-entry strategies.
* **Fighting strategies.** tactics that could destroy value can be beneficial when they raise market share rather than dissipate rents.
  * price cutting.
  * Intensive advertising.
* **Cooperative strategies.**
  * Structure the game such that firms have shared incentives.
  * Impose costs on rivals for non-cooperative actions.
* **Restructuring strategies.** manage or initiate changes in competitive requirements.

**Payoff Matrices** to identify dominant strategies (in the term of game theory) in single-period simultaneous-move games. (1) map out alternatives and payoffs; (2) eliminate dominated strategies; (3) look for ways to shift dominant strategy - jump out of "The Prisoner's Dilemma".
