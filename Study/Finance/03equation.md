The benefits of options:
1. Limit your downside (loss is relatively smaller).
2. Provide **leverage** (return - ratio is much larger).
3. Use as a **hedge** (to reduce risk).

## Random

The **Radiation of Probabilities**. Stock price follows a random walk - [Galton Board](https://www.mathsisfun.com/data/quincunx.html) - Brownian motion.
* a collection of random work creates the **normal distribution**.
* same as heat radiates from regions of high temperature to regions of low temperature.

Bacelier - based on this random model. Price of an option - equalize the profit and loss.

## Earn Money

Thorpe. (Card counting in blackjack) made a risk-free portfolio of options.

* Dynamic Hedging. $\Pi = V - \Delta S$
* Take the draft (<n>momentum in the stock price</n>) into account.
  * cheap -> buy
  * overvalued -> short sell

[The pricing of options and corporate liabilities 1973 Black, F., & Scholes, M.](https://www.jstor.org/stable/1831029) publish the idea. should not exist a risk-free portfolio.
* Change in price = drift + randomness : $dS = Sdt + \delta S dz$
* **Black-Scholes/Merton Equation** : $\frac{\partial V}{\partial t} + rS \frac{\partial V}{\partial S} + \frac{1}{2} \delta^{2} S^{2} \frac{\partial^{2}V}{\partial S^{2}} - rV = 0$
* Following the function, we have **explicit expression** of $C = N(d_{1}) S_{t} - N(d_{2})K e^{-rt}$.
* Chicago Borad Options Exchange (CBOE) founded.

* Challenge to the hypothesis of market efficiency.
* There exist patterns in stock market.
