<img src="/assets/img/paperread/thumbs.png" width="4%" height="4%"/> [Scale-Variant Robust Kernel Optimization for Non-linear Least Squares Problems](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.10305.pdf) (applied in LIO system to prevent outliers) use [Generalized loss function](#lgeneral_loss_fcn) in LIO slam system. As the paper itself said, it does not has obvious improvement on LIO system. *I had tested different robust loss functions also in FAST-LIO system, no improvement found.*

LITERATURE REVIEW (robust estimation):

* Iterative Re-weighted Least Squares (IRLS) : [M-estimators](#lmestimate), fails into de-weighting (donâ€™t directly remove measurements). ([connection to elliptical distributions](#lmestimate-ell)),  Student-t M-estimators. (M-estimation can be solved exactly like a weighted nonlinear least squares problem)
* loop closures: [Dynamic Covariance Scaling](#ldyns), [AEROS](#lareos).

<img src="/assets/img/paperread/thumbs.png" width="4%" height="4%"/> [AEROS: AdaptivE RObust least-Squares for Graph-Based SLAM](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2110.02018.pdf) modelled all loop closures using robust cost functions with a single adaptive parameter and improved back end optimization. Take advantage of the [Black-Rangarajan duality](lbrduality) to convert the optimization problem into an **Iteratively Reweighted Least Squares** (IRLS) problem instead (similar to [robust loss function in ceres](http://ceres-solver.org/nnls_modeling.html#lossfunction)).

<img src="/assets/img/paperread/thumbs.png" width="4%" height="4%"/> [Self-tuning M-estimators 2015](https://europa2.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/files/agamennoni15icra.pdf). Robust least squares is equivalent to maximum-likelihood estimation with elliptically contoured data. One of the advantages of this interpretation is that it enables us to transform the original, non-convex problem into a series of iteratively re-weighted convex sub-problems. This is accomplished via the EM algorithm (Expectation-Maximization).
