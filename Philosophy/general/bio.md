# 1. Human Behavioral Biology

* [My notes and relative documents](https://1drv.ms/u/s!AlcTaQw_X72KhF-bB4_y_Oj85Bl7?e=hBeu45)
* [A list of Robert Sapolsky's Lectures in youtube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLD7E21BF91F3F9683)

One of my favorite sentences :

"The same exact bioloy may make somebody a schizophrenia in a milder form,
will have them being very interested in meta-magical issues, and in the mildest
form allows you to have a fantasy while standing on line in the supermarket.
It's the same biology on the same continuum, and somewhere in there, it stops
being *them and their diseases* and becomes *us and who we are*."


## Biological Underpinnings of Religiosity

This is the 'final lecture' that he mentioned he decided
not to record/post on the official Stanford version of this course.
You can see an old version in [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WwAQqWUkpI&list=PLD7E21BF91F3F9683&index=33&ab_channel=RaulSoto) .

### Schizotypal personality

From the gene lectures we learned that : there is no bad gene, but only
gene in a bad gene-environment interaction.

Recall the depression class and the schizophrenia lectures.
Schizophrenia has strong genetic factor, while at the end of last lecture,
Prof said we didn't come up with a good trait of it. While a milder version of
schizophrenia may help.

There is an experiment that interview thousands of families of schizophrenia in Danmark.
The biological family members have a milder genetic version, now called **schizotypal personality**.

**Expressions** :

* Loose associations, Social withdraw, in some degree (not to schizophrenia level).
* Meta-magical thinking, kind of believe in strange things, science fiction, UFOs, etc. And this is someone who if they have a religious structure of belief, has an extermely **concrete** level of interpretation.

We could relate these concrete image to "the seven days" that god creates the world, snacks with apples, people alive that are once dead, etc.

### Religion

**Shamansim**. There are lectures in 1930s, 40s (anthorpologist, Paul Raiden) "half crazy", Shamans, witch doctors, etc. This was recongized
as a very controlled very socially contextual version of meta-magical schizotypalism. These are the people who
do things *at the right time*. And studies show in most cultures, we always need some meta-magical people around, and they have high social status.
Devereaux referred to primitive religion as being organized schizophrenia, 1940s.
But we are all equally irrational. It leads to **ritualism**.

And we all fall into obsessive little rituals during times of anxiety. We also have rituals intrusive
thoughts that just invade our heads at times where with on obvious purpose.

**OCD**, an anxiety disorder. While there are tremendous advantages of a milder version of OCD.

The leaders of religion, have the best vivid images, and are best at doing the rituals. e.g. Brahmin, in Hinduism.
**numerology**.

They are not to make the anxiety goes away, it's to share it in communities.
But why we need these rituals, why we need a community to share.

People can make a living by doing rituals. (Science fiction : "Xenocide" by Orson Scott Card, a group of people doing nothing other than carrying
out rituals, and other people work hard to feed them) Historical example: 16th century Augustinian monk in Germany named Ludar, Martin Luther.

Experiment with pigeons, with random reward, generate a "superstitious belief".
Allow you to see casual link, that doesn't exist.

# 2. The Illusion of Free Will

* [Dr. Robert Sapolsky: Science of Stress, Testosterone & Free Will](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtmwtjOoSYU)
* [Robert Sapolsky: The Illusion of Free Will - The Origins Podcast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mSWJmzMoTyY)

[Determined: A Science of Life without Free Will](https://vk.com/wall-169240848_34185)
1. [Where did that **intent** come from ?](#l2.1)
2. [PFC (the prefrontal cortex)](#l2.2)
3. [CHAOS](#l2.3)

**we are nothing more or less than the cumulative biological and environmental luck, over which we had no control, that has brought us to any moment.**
we cannot **"show a neuron (or brain) whose generation of a behavior independent of the sum of its biological past"** (there is no room for free will). **Good and bad luck do not balance out in the end.**
<n>人的意志不是一个固定的抽象概念，而是随着环境变化，被“人”和环境的相互作用决定的。</n>

## 2.1 Where did that **intent** come from ?

**Seamless** : <h>each unique biological state was caused (maybe randomly) by a unique state that preceded it.</h>

<img style="float: right;" src="https://www.informationphilosopher.com/solutions/scientists/libet/Libet_Clock.gif" width="25%"/>

1. [Libet's experiment](https://www.informationphilosopher.com/freedom/libet_experiments.html) (though EEG, fMRI, individual neurons monitoring):
  * The subject showed unconscious activity to flex about 350 milliseconds before reporting conscious awareness of the decision to flex.
  * Neurons in the hippocampus were activated 1~2 seconds before.
  * PFC (the prefrontal cortex) was found activated ten seconds before.
  * <U>some neurons activated in preparation for a particular movement decision seconds before subjects claimed they had consciously decided.</u>
  * problems : *conscious intention* vs *consciousness of intention*. *intending* vs *having an intent*. *wanting* vs *intending*, etc.
2. Seconds before: **sensory information** coming from our bodies (i.e. **interoceptive sensation**).
3. Minutes to Days before: the levels of **hormones** in the blood stream and the levels and variants of their receptors in the brain.
  * Testosterone : make preexisting patterns more likely to happen, less generous and more self-centered.
  * Oxytocin (催產素), Vasopressin (抗利尿激素) : enhance mother-infant bonding in mammals (O) (and in males - V). decrease excitability in the amygdala - less aggressive and calmer. Monogamous species.
  * Glucocorticoid (糖皮質素) alter the brain during stress.
4. Weeks to Years before: **neuroplasticity** - brain and body change in response to experience over longer periods.
5. Adolescence:
  * delayed frontal maturation - PFC the brain region last shaped by genes and most shaped by environment.
  * long lasting changes in gene expression.
6. Genes: **gene/environment interactions** - genes are turned on and off by environment.
7. Cultures: historical and ecological circumstances. Tilt the brain construction (to fit cultures), then pass its values to the next generation.
  * east-west comparison. collectivist-individualist cultures comparison.

> In order to prove there is free will, you have to show that some behavior just happened out of the thin air in the sense of considering all these biological precursors. ... Free will can exit only if neurons' actions are completely uninfluenced by all the uncontrollable factors that came before.


Misunderstanding :
* Self-formation (Robert Kane) : *How did you get to be the kind of person you now are?*
* Second-order free will (Peter Tse) : *free will now - who you are going to be in the future*.
* Finn, squanderes, Albright : partial free will - *choose what we do with those attributes* (that we have no control).

## 2.2 PFC (the prefrontal cortex)

**PFC**: **do the right thing when it is the harder thing to do.** -> <h>PFC can explain our decision making, fewer room for free will exclude PFC.</h>
* right : in a neurobiological and instrumental sense rather than a moral one.
* **context! context! context!**
* PFC is the outcome of all the uncontrollable biology interacting with all that uncontrollable environment.

1. Seconds to Hours before : sensory information modulates PFC function.
  * when not enough energy on board, PFC doesn't work well -> terrified, in pain, fatigue, hunger, etc.
2. Hours to Days before : hormonal effects on PFC - change gene expression.
3. Days to Years before : neuroplasticity in response to experiences.
4. Adolescent social experience.
5. Family changes children.(1) childhood abuse changes brain; (2) socioeconomic status.
6. Genes : the variation in versions of genes help explain variation in the volume of the frontal cortex, its level of activity, and performance on PFC-dependent tasks. (1) neurotransmitter serotonin (血清素); (2) gene-environment.
7. Cultures : east-west comparison. collectivist-individualist cultures comparison.

## 2.3 CHAOS

**Reductionism** : breakdown complicated thing into parts to understand. [CHAOS](/Math/NDS/chaos/) : complicated things **cannot** be understood on a reductive level.
* example : [Cellular Automata](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/cellular-automata/), [Cellular Automata Simulator](https://robinforest.net/post/cellular-automata/).

**WRONG conclusions** :
1. *The freely choosing cloud*. (1) determinism is not equal to predictability; (2) unpredictable but can be explained.
2. *A causeless fire*. we cannot do radical eliminative reductionism and decide what caused the fire, but that *doesn't mean that the fire wasn't actually caused by anything*.

**CHAOS does not lead to free will.**
