# Multiresolution Analysis


[mathlab example](https://www.mathworks.com/help/wavelet/ug/practical-introduction-to-multiresolution-analysis.html)
Multiresolution analysis refers to breaking up a signal into components, which produce the original signal exactly when added back together. To be useful for data analysis, how the signal is decomposed is important.


A multiresolution analysis of the Lebesgue space $ L^{2}(\mathbb {R} )$ consists of a sequence of nested subspaces
