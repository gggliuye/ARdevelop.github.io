* *A Passion for Cooperation* By Robert Axelrod.

Qualities for a good strategy:
* Nice
* Forgiving
* Retaliatory (If your opponent defects, strike back immediately. Don't be a pushover)
* Clear (not too complicated)

**Tir for Tat** (以牙还牙) wins most of the games.
* **evaulation of populations for different strategies.** generation grow.
* **TfT** is not robust for noise. A slight more forgiving TfT.
* Real world is not a zero mean game.

<img src="/assets/img/paperread/chrown0.png" height="25"/> [Social dilemmas among unequals 2019](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31413366/) : some endowment inequality can be necessary for cooperation to prevail.

* <u>Extreme inequality prevents cooperation</u>, but some endowment inequality can be necessary for cooperation to prevail (when individuals are naturally heterogeneous).
  * For linear and symmetric games, if cooperation is feasible at all, it is feasible for equal endowments.
  * However, if the game is asymmetric or nonlinear, <u>full cooperation may only be feasible when players have unequal endowments.</u>
* Overall welfare is maximized when the two sources of heterogeneity are aligned, such that <u>more productive individuals receive higher endowments.</u> A twofold advantage of giving higher endowments to more productive players:
  1. **stability advantage**: an unequal distribution of endowments makes it easier for full cooperation to be an equilibrium.
  2. **efficiency advantage**: social welfare is maximized.
