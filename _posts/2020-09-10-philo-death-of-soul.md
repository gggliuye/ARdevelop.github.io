Classes on Death, from Philosophy 176, of Yale University.

### Phaedo, Plato

The main driving of the *Phaedo* : Do we have any reason to believe the soul could survive the death of the body?
The existance of the soul is taken for granted in the dialogue. And Plato is a dualist, so he built *Socrates* to be dualist, and believe that the immortality of the soul.

Body do the sensation stuff, soul do the thinking stuff. The soul can think of certain concepts, or ideas.
There is nothing in this world that's perfectly beautiful, yet we can think about perfect beauty itself (same for perfect justice, perfect circularity). The mind has some kind of handle on these perfect “Platonic ideas”, "Platonic forms" (*Platonic Forms*).
Plato's thought that he puts in Socrates' mouth : *what the philosopher tries to do is to free himself from the distractions that the body poses* , all these distractions get in the way of thinking about the Platonic forms, so the philosopher would want to separate his mind as much as possible from the body. And he believe, when the death come and the final separation occurs, his mind gets to go up to *Plato's heaven*.

For an example, think of mathematics. When we talk about math, we are talking about numbers that the mind trying to grasp, while numbers are not physical objects. They are **Platonic abstract entities** that don't exist in space and time. Yet for all that, the mind can think about them.

Based on these, Plato try to argue that the soul can be immortal.
