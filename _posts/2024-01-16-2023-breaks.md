[2023's Biggest Breakthroughs in Computer Science](https://www.quantamagazine.org/the-biggest-discoveries-in-computer-science-in-2023-20231220/)


1. Hyper-dimensional Computing ([Vector-Driven AI](https://www.quantamagazine.org/a-new-approach-to-computation-reimagines-artificial-intelligence-20230413/)) : Symbolic AI + Statistic AI. by using vectors.
2. Quantum factoring algorithms (break large numbers into prime factors) - break modern cryptography. [Regev's algorithm](https://www.quantamagazine.org/thirty-years-later-a-speed-boost-for-quantum-factoring-20231017/) (using high-dimensional lattice), could speed up *Shor's algorithm*.
3. [Large AI Models](https://www.quantamagazine.org/the-unpredictable-abilities-emerging-from-large-ai-models-20230316/). *“Emergent Behaviors”* in large language models — AI programs trained on enormous collections of text to produce humanlike writing.


[2023's Biggest Breakthroughs in Biology and Neuroscience](https://www.quantamagazine.org/the-biggest-discoveries-in-biology-in-2023-20231219/)

1. The Investigation of Consciousness, distinguish [Reality and Imagination](https://www.quantamagazine.org/is-it-real-or-imagined-how-your-brain-tells-the-difference-20230524/) using neuroimaging.
  * **Reality Threshold** (not boolean) - when imagined view is vivid, we might confused it with reality.
  * PFC (prefrontal cortex) and VC (visual cortex) may be directly involved in this process.
2.  Microbiomes Evolve With Us. [Global Microbiome Study Gives New View of Shared Health Risks](https://www.quantamagazine.org/global-microbiome-study-gives-new-view-of-shared-health-risks-20230314/). The organisms in our **microbiome** (the collection of bacteria and other cells that live in our guts and elsewhere on our body) spread between people, especially those with whom we spend the most time.
  * This raises the intriguing possibility that some illnesses that aren’t usually considered communicable might be.
3. How Life Keeps Time, [Mitochondria Keep Time](https://www.quantamagazine.org/what-makes-life-tick-mitochondria-may-keep-time-for-cells-20230918/) in biological process - **tissues mature** (which vary dramatically between species). Mitochondria may very well serve dual roles as both the timekeeper and power source for complex cells.


[2023's Biggest Breakthroughs in Physics](https://www.quantamagazine.org/the-biggest-discoveries-in-physics-in-2023-20231221/)
1. [Low-Frequency Gravitational Waves](https://www.quantamagazine.org/an-enormous-gravity-hum-moves-through-the-universe-20230628/)
2. [Quantum Energy Teleportation](https://www.quantamagazine.org/physicists-use-quantum-mechanics-to-pull-energy-out-of-nothing-20230222/) effectively borrowing energy from a distant location and thus violating no sacred physical principles.
  * teleport information through quantum entanglement.
3. [Discoveries from the James Webb Space Telescope](https://www.quantamagazine.org/jwst-spots-giant-black-holes-all-over-the-early-universe-20230814/) including observations of light from galaxies that glowed some 300 million years after the Big Bang and an abundance of supermassive black holes.  [WEBB NASA](https://webb.nasa.gov/).


[2023's Biggest Breakthroughs in Math](https://www.quantamagazine.org/the-biggest-discoveries-in-math-in-2023-20231222/)
1. Ramsey Numbers. [A new, tighter upper bound to Ramsey numbers](https://www.quantamagazine.org/after-nearly-a-century-a-new-limit-for-patterns-in-graphs-20230502/) - R(n) measures the size that graphs must reach before inevitably containing n cliques.
2. Aperiodic Monotile - **one** tile that covers the plane but only in a pattern that never repeats - [Tiling's Holy Grail](https://www.quantamagazine.org/hobbyist-finds-maths-elusive-einstein-tile-20230404/)
  * a continuum of an infinite set of 13 sided aperiodic tiles.
  * Aperiodic Monotile without reflection.
3. [Three Arithmetic Progressions Problem](https://www.quantamagazine.org/surprise-computer-science-proof-stuns-mathematicians-20230321/) : How many integers can you throw into a bucket while making sure that no three of them form an evenly spaced progression?
  * Kelley and Meka smashed a long-standing upper bound on the number of integers smaller than some cap N that could be put in the bucket without creating such a pattern.
