Classes on Death, from Philosophy 176.

## Dualism and Physicism

The relationship of body and soul(mind).

* The body and the mind are different representations (or cognitions) of the same thing.
* Dualism (interactive) : The body and mind are two seperate things with very tight connection. And death might be the seveing of the connection.


In the assumption of the **Dualism**:

* Are body and soul distinct. (i.e. are there soul?)
* If there are soul, can soul survives the death of the body?
* If survive, how  long? Does it continue to exist forever?

Soul are reserved for immaterial stuff, it may not have a physics location.

**Materialist** view : people is just a material object, just a "body" (but not any old body) that can do some amazing things. For example, "smile" ( "mind" in our case here), the materialists don't deny smile. Talking about smile, is actually talking about the body ability to smile. There is mind, and talking about "The Mind", is actually talking about the body ability to do various things. Death is just the breaking down of the body, so it will not function any more.

"Mind" is talking about the abilities of the body. And we all admit its existence.

### 1. Is there soul?

Something we say exist, is that we can see, touch or feel it. How can we tell the existance of "soul" when we can't feel it.
For an example "atoms", we infer the exitence of atoms, because it can explain things (physics laws).
We infer the existence of thins we cannot see, to explain something we can't otherwise explain.
**Inference to the best explanation** : we always choose the best explanation.

For the existence of soul : *Are there things about us that the physicalist cannot explain?* could give us some reason to believe the soul. **Feature P (people)** : One aspect, the ordinary thing about us, another aspect, the super-nature things.

**Ordinary things**  :
* What animates the body? Must there be something outside the body that control the body? We are different from the robots, do we need soul to explain **free will** ?
* The ability to think, reason, brief, desires, make strategies, etc. For example, the computer playing programmings. What grouds are there for withholding ascriptions of beliefs and desires to the computer? Are we just using asumptions to "argue" the argument? That's far from obvious. Are these just illusions? Maybe there is a **action side** and an **emotional side** of the desires (that machines don't have). Then it lead to the question : *Could a pure physics being feel emotions?*

**Emotion** : we have the behavioral aspect of feeling, and the sensation part of *what the feeling feels like* (or we call it **qualitative experiences** ) . For dualism point of view, a pure physice body cannot have the sensation part of emotion. For example, can blind people "feel" red? He have the notation of the red color, knows the apple is read, while in the mean time, he cannot actually have the feeling of feel red (as he cannot really see). The materialist may argue : we are not yet able to explain soul in physical view, is not equal to we won't possibly able to explain it (For an example, life in 14th century) .  And we don't want any explanation, we want a better explanation. So one may ask : how soul can have conciousness?  and we cannot answer it. *This is actually a tie.*

**Creativity** : could there be a pyhsics object that is creative?
