## Identity

**We assume the soul doesn't exist in the following sections**.
What is it, for me, to survive a period? Is the person here next week, the same person? For me, to survive next week. And think for a longer period, for an example 40 years. For clearify them, we must figure out some concepts : Identity across space and time, person identity.

### Space Identity

Example : the extended-through-space train. We pointing the locomotive to identify the same train as we pointing the caboose. *Are they the same train?*

![Train](../assets/pose_image/train.jpg){: .mx-auto.d-block :}


### Time Identity

Example: the extended-through-time car. when pointing the car, we are not pointing the slice of car, but the entire extended-through-time object. The slices aren't the same, the cars are the same.
