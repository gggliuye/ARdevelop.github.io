## Identity

**We assume the soul doesn't exist in the following sections**.
What is it, for me, to survive a period? Is the person here next week, the same person? For me, to survive next week. And think for a longer period, for an example 40 years. For clearify them, we must figure out some concepts : Identity across space and time, personal identity.

### Space Identity

Example : the extended-through-space train. We pointing the locomotive to identify the same train as we pointing the caboose. *Are they the same train?*

<!--  ![Train](../assets/post_image/train.jpg){: .mx-auto.d-block :} -->

<img src="../assets/post_image/train.jpg" alt="Train" class="mx-auto d-block" width="50%">

What if some part of the train is blocked.

<img src="../assets/post_image/train_block.jpg" alt="Train Block" class="mx-auto d-block" width="50%">

If we have X-ray to look through the block.
* It could be the train is seperate in the middle, there are actually two trains.
* Or it is the same extended-through-space object.

### Time Identity

Example: the extended-through-time car. when pointing the car, we are not pointing the slice of car, but the entire extended-through-time object. The slices aren't the same, the cars are the same.

<img src="../assets/post_image/car.jpg" alt="Car" class="mx-auto d-block" width="50%">

Same for the "blockage", if we lost the car in a period, then find 'the car'. If we cannot figure out what happened this period, we cannot sure if it is the same extended-through-time car, or it is another car.

And we may ask : **What makes two stages, stages of the very same thing?**. The trian connection make them the same object.  
* What is the metaphysical glues for the extended-through-time car : being the same hunk of stuff (even the consistuent atoms are changed, even bigger parts).
* How many changes of the consistuent parts can you have and still be the same hunk of stuff ?

### Personal Identity

Is SK 2007 the very same person as **the extend-through-time person** (*space time worm*) that you got in mind when pointing to Mr.X 2050 (we are not asking the person stages/slices). Answer : *it depends on whether the stages are glued together in the right metaphysical way.*
( *Can we survive the death of the body?* to answer it we need to clear about what does it take to have identity across time.)

* For dualism, the key is having the same soul. Think about God takes my soul, and replace it with another soul, with all my memories, my experiences, my desires, etc , pluged in. In the dualism view, he won't be me, as he has a different soul. While there will be no way at all for him to know that. *How do we know if it happens?* (raised by John Locke) . It is not plausible. So we concludes here, even if the soul do exists, they may not be the key to personal identity.
