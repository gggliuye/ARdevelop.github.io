**Detailed TimeLine:**

* 2021 Oct : Meta & BMW announced a partnership on XR-in-car problem. [^metaaria]
  * Problem of [Non-inertial reference frame](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-inertial_reference_frame): cameras and Imu are in conflict.
* 2022 Nov : HoloRide €700 kit, contains HTC’s ultra-compact Vive Flow headset and a wireless gamepad (€50) [^holoride]. [youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hn8xl4c8JSk).
  * Technology (3DOF + Canbus + recenter):
    * using only IMU for giving 3DOF movement (rotation only).
    * need user interface to recenter the screen (to driving direction).
    * (Audi only) uses the car's real steering, accelerating, and braking as virtual movement.
* 2022 Dec : DeepMirror Car XR [^dmcar].
  * Enable localization in moving vehicles, combined with car’s precise 6DOF.
  * We could output : (1) 3dof w.r.t. car; (2) 6dof w.r.t world.

* 2023 May : Meta & BMW Quest Working In A Moving Car [^metabmw] [^metabmw_meta].
  * collaborated with BMW to incorporate IMU data from a BMW car’s sensor array in real time into the tracking system of XR devices.
  * Next step : add the car’s location relative to the world, using the car’s precise 6DOF positioning system.
  * not yet ready for customers.

* 2023 Oct : BMW metaverse [^bmwmeta].
* 2024 Jan : Apple Vision Pro [^avptm] Travel Mode.
  * Cannot work properly on moving vehicles.
* 2024 May : Meta Travel Mode with 6DOF[^tm]. It enables Quest to run in a moving car (where AVP's travel mode failed to work).
* 2024 Aug : DeepMirror Car XR incar-6dof offering 6dof w.r.t. both car and world.

## Some analysis

Meta's develop path : <u>switch from imu based slam system to pure vision slam system</u>, to overcome the "Non-inertial reference frame" problem. This might be a good method, reducing the complexity of the system without tightly coupling with car's imu.

Deepmirror's develop path : we had moved faster than META, but with limited resources, have fewer hardware support. It took us longer to reach the pure vision method (same end).

Current trends: few customers are willing to try VR in moving vehicles, this market might has limited flexibility.

**Key Assumptions** of "Extended Reality for Vehicles" :
1. Technology is achievable. ✅
2. Customers are willing to use VR in vehicles. 🤔
