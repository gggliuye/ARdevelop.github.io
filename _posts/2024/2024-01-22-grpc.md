we want to make the fastest one way stream message flow between two devices. so we check different comparison.


### check different communication protocols

[HTTP, WebSocket, gRPC or WebRTC](https://getstream.io/blog/communication-protocols/)

* **TCP and UDP**:
  * **TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)** : A connection is first established before data exchange, and uses error correction to ensure message deriveray.
  * **UDP (User Datagram Protocol)** : connectionless (does not require a connection), data can be losted, but faster.
* **HTTP/1** use TCP (built to handle long-lived connections to transfer large data), open short-lived TCP connections and usually only send small pieces of data.
* **HTTP/2** was designed to address the shortcomings of the original HTTP protocol (HTTP/1.1) and to improve performance.
  * use of multiplexing to simultaneously send and receive multiple HTTP requests and responses over a single TCP connection.
  * All HTTP/2 connections are persistent, and only one connection per origin is required.

* **WebSocket** two-way, handle real-time data. effectively run as a transport layer over TCP. provides a lot of freedom compared to HTTP/2.
  * [HTTP/2 or Websockets for low latency client to server messages](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/50956757/http-2-or-websockets-for-low-latency-client-to-server-messages/59690386#59690386)
  * WebSockets are best suited for applications that need <u>two-way communication in real-time and when small pieces of data need to be transmitted quickly.</u>
* **Server Sent Events (SSE)** are efficient over HTTP/2 and simple to use : the server unilaterally pushes data to the client.
* **gRPC** RPC framework uses HTTP/2. uses *protocol buffers* to make it cross language friendly.
  * It can be complicated to set up compared to WebSockets.
* **WebRTC** can make direct peer-to-peer connections.
  * low latency and a lot of data.
  * but connection establishing is complicated. and it needs to be a way for two peers to discover each other.
* **WebTransport** a potential replacement for WebSockets. [Using WebTransport](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/capabilities/web-apis/webtransport), [github c++](https://github.com/open-webrtc-toolkit/owt-sdk-quic).

### grpc benchmark

[Comparing gRPC performance across different technologies](https://www.nexthink.com/blog/comparing-grpc-performance):

### grpc stream sync vs. async

* [server & client reference](https://groups.google.com/g/grpc-io/c/2wyoDZT5eao).
* async version is much better for one way message stream.
