[Getting Started with the ESP32 Development Board](https://randomnerdtutorials.com/getting-started-with-esp32/):
* Processor: Tensilica Xtensa Dual-Core 32-bit LX6 microprocessor, running at 160 or 240 MHz. The ESP32 is the ESP8266 successor.
* ESP32 Development Boards come with all the needed circuitry to power and program the chip.
* [Compatible with the Arduino “programming language”](https://randomnerdtutorials.com/installing-esp32-arduino-ide-2-0/).
  * [Installing ESP32 Board in Arduino IDE 2](https://randomnerdtutorials.com/installing-esp32-arduino-ide-2-0/)
* [Compatible with MicroPython](https://randomnerdtutorials.com/getting-started-micropython-esp32-esp8266/).



## ESP32-CAM

[Compatible with the Arduino “programming language”](https://randomnerdtutorials.com/installing-esp32-arduino-ide-2-0/).
1. [Installing ESP32 Board in Arduino IDE 2](https://randomnerdtutorials.com/installing-esp32-arduino-ide-2-0/). (attention if you are in a virtual env, when you try to install dependent python libs)
2. Use board **AI-Thinker ESP32-CAM**.
3. Try the example code project: [ESP32-CAM Take Photo and Display in Web Server](https://randomnerdtutorials.com/esp32-cam-take-photo-display-web-server/).
