# 1. Intro to AR/VR/MR/XR

[Coursera - Intro to AR/VR/MR/XR: Technologies, Applications & Issues](https://www.coursera.org/learn/intro-augmented-virtual-mixed-extended-reality-technologies-applications-issues/home/module/1), [Certification link](https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/verify/RRQT9G8G20QB).

* Virtual Reality, Augmented Reality, Mixed Reality.
* Four classes of XR technology: devices, platforms, applications, and tools.
* People – Tasks – Technology: the three main angles used to explore the question of how to use our understanding of people, their tasks, and technical capabilities to design better systems?
* Key issues: social and ethical concerns, accessibility and equity, privacy and security.


XR strategy : **knowledge, team, equipment, and users.**

* Knowledge: XR applications, technologies, key issues, design principles, and development tools.
* Team: designers, developers, managers, artists, researchers, and entrepreneurs.
* Equipment:  smartphones and exploring ways to turn them into AR or VR devices.
* Users: growing.


Cases Study :

# 2. User Experience & Interaction Design for AR/VR/MR/XR

[Coursera - User Experience & Interaction Design for AR/VR/MR/XR](https://www.coursera.org/learn/user-experience-interaction-design-augmented-virtual-mixed-extended-reality/home/module/1), [Certification link](https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/verify/).


* XR Experiences : (1) Environment (Real; Virtual); (2) 3D Characters (Avatars; 3D models; Data); (3) Interactions (Explicit, Implicit).
* Four major steps: (1) needfinding & brainstorming, (2) storyboarding & prototyping, (3) development & testing, and (4) deployment & analytics.

**Design Thinking** : Building empathy with your users.
* Challenge : Build empathy with limited users.
* (1) Empathize; (2) Define (the problem); (3) Ideate; (4) Prototype; (5) Test; (6) Implement.
* Design Keys:
  * Problem Statement (Scenarios - Setting, Agents, Goals, Actions, Events).
  * "The User" (Personas).
  * Competitive Analysis (SWOT)..
  * Design Space Analysis (QOC - Questions & Options & Criterion).
* Additional video : 💡 [XR Design Theory and Practice for Digital Eyewear 2020](https://youtu.be/4o__z7aPlMw?si=cfg-akDGSyJljZRG)


**Design Ethics** : Ethical and responsible design. About the acquisition and use of personal data.
* <u>Autonomy, Transparency, Safety.</u>
* Ethics Review:
  1. Define purpose, procedure, and duration.
  2. Maximize benefits / limit trade-offs.
  3. Minimize risks.
  4. Empower participants.
* Design Ethics Review:
  1. Context & Situation : where is the XR device being used? Who is around the user?
  2. Sensory Information & Data : What does the XR device see? What kind of data is acquired?
  3. Processing Pipeline : What happens on-device? What happens in the cloud?
  4. Data Ownership & Governance : Who owns and manages the data? How is the user informed?
* Design impact:
  * Before : set expectations of users for new reality.
  * During : balance realism, comfort, safety.
  * After : help users transition back to old reality.

Design Guidelines : Best practices and patterns of design.
* By Vendors (platform driven), By Designers (user oriented), By Practitioners (experience based), By Researchers (empirically derived).

Design Critiques : Learning from existing interfaces.
* I like ... I wish ... What if ?
* Evaluation : Usability; Usefulness; Utility; User Acceptance.


Design Jams : Solving design challenges collaboratively.

# Random Ideas

1. 有时候想要记住一个场景，将它重建并且可以通过VR“回去”。（尤其是曾经的家）
2. AR的对焦问题。
