[Extended Reality for Everybody](https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/specialization/PI13GZ2H7PE2) The XR Process can be broken down into four major steps: (1) needfinding & brainstorming, (2) storyboarding & prototyping (both (1) and (2) are the focus of the second course in the XR series), (3) development & testing (the focus of this course), and (4) deployment & analytics.

1. [Intro to AR/VR/MR/XR](#l1).
2. [Design](#l2): Design Thinking, Design Ethics, Design Guidelines, Design Jams, Design Critiques.
3. [Development](#l3): The development of XR applications with WebXR, Unity & Unreal.
4. [Some Ideas](#l4).

# 1. Intro to AR/VR/MR/XR

[Coursera - Intro to AR/VR/MR/XR: Technologies, Applications & Issues](https://www.coursera.org/learn/intro-augmented-virtual-mixed-extended-reality-technologies-applications-issues/home/module/1), [Certification link](https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/verify/RRQT9G8G20QB).

</div>

* Virtual Reality, Augmented Reality, Mixed Reality.
* Four classes of XR technology: devices, platforms, applications, and tools.
* People ‚Äì Tasks ‚Äì Technology: the three main angles used to explore the question of how to use our understanding of people, their tasks, and technical capabilities to design better systems?
* Key issues: social and ethical concerns, accessibility and equity, privacy and security.


XR strategy : **knowledge, team, equipment, and users.**

* Knowledge: XR applications, technologies, key issues, design principles, and development tools.
* Team: designers, developers, managers, artists, researchers, and entrepreneurs.
* Equipment:  smartphones and exploring ways to turn them into AR or VR devices.
* Users: growing.


Cases Study :
* [Niantic Case Study](https://nianticlabs.com/en/about/).
* [Oculus Case Studies](https://forwork.meta.com/vr-insights/).
* [Microsoft Case Studies](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/mixed-reality/discover/case-studies-overview).

# 2. User Experience & Interaction Design for AR/VR/MR/XR

[Coursera - User Experience & Interaction Design for AR/VR/MR/XR](https://www.coursera.org/learn/user-experience-interaction-design-augmented-virtual-mixed-extended-reality/home/module/1), [Certification link](https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/verify/686ZDMK2RFC9).


* XR Experiences : (1) Environment (Real; Virtual); (2) 3D Characters (Avatars; 3D models; Data); (3) Interactions (Explicit, Implicit).
* Four major steps: (1) needfinding & brainstorming, (2) storyboarding & prototyping, (3) development & testing, and (4) deployment & analytics.

**Design Thinking** : Building empathy with your users.
* Challenge : Build empathy with limited users.
* (1) Empathize; (2) Define (the problem); (3) Ideate; (4) Prototype; (5) Test; (6) Implement.
* Design Keys:
  * Problem Statement (Scenarios - Setting, Agents, Goals, Actions, Events).
  * "The User" (Personas).
  * Competitive Analysis (SWOT)..
  * Design Space Analysis (QOC - Questions & Options & Criterion).
* Additional video : üí° [XR Design Theory and Practice for Digital Eyewear 2020](https://youtu.be/4o__z7aPlMw?si=cfg-akDGSyJljZRG)


**Design Ethics** : Ethical and responsible design. About the acquisition and use of personal data.
* <u>Autonomy, Transparency, Safety.</u>
* Ethics Review:
  1. Define purpose, procedure, and duration.
  2. Maximize benefits / limit trade-offs.
  3. Minimize risks.
  4. Empower participants.
* Design Ethics Review:
  1. Context & Situation : where is the XR device being used? Who is around the user?
  2. Sensory Information & Data : What does the XR device see? What kind of data is acquired?
  3. Processing Pipeline : What happens on-device? What happens in the cloud?
  4. Data Ownership & Governance : Who owns and manages the data? How is the user informed?
* Design impact:
  * Before : set expectations of users for new reality.
  * During : balance realism, comfort, safety.
  * After : help users transition back to old reality.

**Design Guidelines** : Best practices and patterns of design. <u>By Vendors (platform driven), By Designers (user oriented), By Practitioners (experience based), By Researchers (empirically derived).</u>

**Design Jams** : Solving design challenges collaboratively. Mini project plan; Scenarios; Personas; Storyboards; Physical Prototypes; Digital Prototypes.

**Design Critiques** : Learning from existing interfaces.
* I like ... I wish ... What if ?
* Evaluation : Usability; Usefulness; Utility; User Acceptance.

## 2.2 Brainstorming

**Brainstorming & Problem framing**. Seven Techniques to Help You Innovate
1. Ideate‚ÄìImplement‚ÄìInspect‚ÄìIterate Design Cycle.
2. ‚ÄúKiller-App‚Äù Problem / Novelty ‚â† Creativity.
3. Problem‚ÄìPromise‚ÄìPremise Approach. (why important? what is the value proposition? what are your assumptions?)
4. Write the Intro First Approach. (problem, obstacle, solution in essence, contribution scientifically)
5. [Idea Hexagon](https://medium.com/spotprobe/the-hexagon-of-ideas-02e5b770d75e): a conceptual framework that to navigate through the multifaceted world of invention. [How to Think Like an MIT Media Lab Inventor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnJPtEJj4s)
6. Object-Control Design Matrix.
7. Threshold & Ceiling in Tool Design. (lower-bound and upper-bound of different tools)

|  good ideas | bad ideas |
|--------------|-------------|
| * You're adding a significant new feature to an existing solution <br>* You're doing a redesign of part of an existing solution <br>* You're picking one particular aspect of a problem and try a different solution <br>* You're looking at an existing problem through a new lens | * You're just adding a small new feature to an existing solution <br>* You're trying to make an existing solution ‚Äúmuch better‚Äù <br>* You're trying to do what multiple existing solutions do in one new solution <br>* You're trying to do what nobody else has done before |

## 2.3 Prototyping

(1) **Organizing Sketches into Storyboards**. Storyboards organize sketches into sequences to illustrate user flow. Wireframing: blueprint of screen and VR scenes. [video playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL2ydFiyrSWQlBAAbNdURDyDYwWBGcTJtN)

(2) **Physical Prototyping**, [video playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL2ydFiyrSWQlJcQmxrH-NOR-EOMICOl4r).
1. Paper prototyping: good for thinking through interactions.
2. 3D modeling with clay : good for creating the main 3d characters.
3. [Diorama](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diorama) : good for thinking through proxemics.
4. 360 paper prototyping : good for thinking spatially around the user.

(3) **Digital Prototyping** digital authoring tools to mock up the XR experience with interactions happening in VR or AR. (1) Digital & Immersive Authoring; (2) Web-based development; (3) Cross-platform development;  (4) Native development.

**Testing Physical and Digital Prototypes**
