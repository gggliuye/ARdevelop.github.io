* Virtual Reality, Augmented Reality, Mixed Reality.
* Four classes of XR technology: devices, platforms, applications, and tools.
* People – Tasks – Technology: the three main angles used to explore the question of how to use our understanding of people, their tasks, and technical capabilities to design better systems?
* Key issues: social and ethical concerns, accessibility and equity, privacy and security.


XR strategy : **knowledge, team, equipment, and users.**

* Knowledge: XR applications, technologies, key issues, design principles, and development tools.
* Team: designers, developers, managers, artists, researchers, and entrepreneurs.
* Equipment:  smartphones and exploring ways to turn them into AR or VR devices.
* Users: growing.


Cases Study :
* [Niantic Case Study](https://nianticlabs.com/en/about/).
* [Oculus Case Studies](https://forwork.meta.com/vr-insights/).
* [Microsoft Case Studies](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/mixed-reality/discover/case-studies-overview).


# User Experience & Interaction Design for AR/VR/MR/XR

[Coursera - User Experience & Interaction Design for AR/VR/MR/XR](https://www.coursera.org/learn/user-experience-interaction-design-augmented-virtual-mixed-extended-reality/home/module/1), [Certification link](https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/verify/).


* XR Experiences : (1) Environment (Real; Virtual); (2) 3D Characters (Avatars; 3D models; Data); (3) Interactions (Explicit, Implicit).
* Four major steps: (1) needfinding & brainstorming, (2) storyboarding & prototyping, (3) development & testing, and (4) deployment & analytics.

* Design Thinking : Building empathy with your users.
  * Challenge : Build empathy with limited users.
  * (1) Empathize; (2) Define (the problem); (3) Ideate; (4) Prototype; (5) Test; (6) Implement.
* Design Ethics : Ethical and responsible design.
  * Autonomy, Transparency, Safety.
* Design Guidelines : Best practices and patterns of design.
  * By Vendors (platform driven), By Designers (user oriented), By Practitioners (experience based), By Researchers (empirically derived).
* Design Critiques : Learning from existing interfaces.
  * I like ... I wish ... What if ?
  * Evaluation : Usability; Usefulness; Utility; User Acceptance.
* Design Jams : Solving design challenges collaboratively.

# Random Ideas

1. 有时候想要记住一个场景，将它重建并且可以通过VR“回去”。（尤其是曾经的家）
