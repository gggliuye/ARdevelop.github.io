### Some thought about VINS

When working in a company out of school, I found I am kind of lost, nobody tells me what to do, or how to make myself better.
I must find a correct direction for myself. For my recent work, I am thinking some possible choices:

+ **ORBSLAM with IMU** : This is an update based on a open source project, and It has already been done by someone else. However, I is a wonderful examine for my recent study, VIO system. It should be of some useness, and it is easier to complete.
+ **VINS with map building and reuse** : The current VINS Fusion does has map building support, but it has great limitation as well as the VINS system.
+ **Deep Learning Feature Extraction** : This is also a possible direction, however it is more into Deep Learning area. I should learn more before entering into another domain.
+ **Visual Lidar SLAM** : This is a wonderful subject.
+ **Image Retrieval Methods**

We want to use VINS to realize AR applications.
